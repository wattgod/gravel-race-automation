      "transcript": "I'm back home post a lovely weekend in\nScotland\n[Music]\ndecided to go and do the UCI gravel race\nso it's like the first UCI gravel race\nin the UK it was quite long so it's\nlonger than the king's cup which I did\nback in the 2021\nso I thought that'd be better for me\nbecause I figured like longer\nmy endurance will come into it and yeah\nstill didn't look too technical so that\nwas my other thing of make sure it's not\ntoo technical so we traveled up on\nThursday had a little look at the course\non Friday and then the race was Saturday\nand yeah like the weather was perfect it\nwas like slightly overcast but nice and\nwarm\nbut not too hot which is the good things\nthe feed stations are all like\nself-service like you had to like\nactually stop and pick stuff up so like\nit not being too hot was good from a\nracing perspective I managed to get one\nof the sort of preferred starts so I\nmanaged to start like right at the front\nwhich was quite cool with like some of\nthe proper cyclists people like Tiffany\nCromwell which yeah felt I felt a little\nbit out of the place but I was like at\nleast I'm in a good place to start and\nthe start of the race is basically like\na 6K climb so I knew that first bit was\ngoing to be really really hard and it\nwas really hard I think I was probably\nover like 300 watts for about eight\nminutes of like just full gas up the\nclimb but got myself into really good\nposition like I was at the front\nand there's a bit on the first bit the\nclimber it kind of\ndescends a little bit before climbing\nagain and there's like a sharp right\nhand corner which I basically got a bit\nexcited and forgot how to corner so kind\nof rather than taking on us out sort of\njust went straight off the side I had to\nlike unclip get myself back into it so I\nwas like pretty annoyed at myself\nbecause if I just slow down a little bit\nand remembered hard corner I would have\nbeen fine but anyway got myself back on\nchased back up to one of the chase\ngroups and then managed to actually\nproperly fall off on the on the sharp\nleft hand corner which I actually think\nI just hit a rock slightly awkwardly\nbecause I wasn't going very fast at that\npoint having already crashed I was\ntrying to be cautious Spanish like\nproperly fall off there but again got\nback up all fine\nI then had to stop and properly unscrew\nmy butter cage because one of the bolts\nwould come out so it was then clanging\nonto my chainring which obviously I\ncouldn't ride like that so that was\nprobably like another minute of faffing\nabout and then I was like right just get\nyourself back in the game now\nwent really hard for probably like 15\nminutes managed to catch back onto\nI think they were like the second Chase\ngroup and then we were all working quite\nnicely together and we managed to catch\nthe\nsort of I think they were like the\nsecond group on the road I think Tiffany\nby that point had already broken away\naround like 30k we were then like an all\nin this nice little group of about seven\neight of us working quite nicely I was\nlike this is perfect it's like I'm back\nin the race and get over those silly\nmistakes now and just concentrate\nand then I got a puncher didn't have any\nstuff with me because basically decided\nit's a race if I get a puncher it's kind\nof game over\nand they had Tech boxes like every five\nto 10K so I was like it won't be that\nfar to get although you obviously then\nforget that when you're walking because\nyou can't ride because you've got enough\nof a puncture and the gravel's like\nproperly chunky gravel a lot of it so\nyou can't really just ride through on no\npressure\n5K is quite a long way to walk but I\nmanaged to kind of like Scoot a little\nbit walk a little bit I then found a\nlady that had also punctured but damaged\nher rim\nwho lent me a canister to kind of get a\nbit more pressure to try and get to a\ntech box got to tech box managed to get\na couple more canisters get the tire up\nand going a little bit obviously haven't\nfixed it properly so I thought by this\npoint the sealant would have kicked in\nand it kind of didn't really because the\nslit was in my sidewall so then sort of\nmanaged to again do a bit of scooting a\nbit of walking to get to the second feed\nstation at sort of 60k\nand they had like more mechanicy stuff\nso I was a bit like okay and I think we\neither need to change the tire put some\nplugs in like I've never put plugs in in\nmy life but that's what people told me I\nneeded to do the guy there helping had\nabout as much idea of how to do\nmechanics as me so between the two of us\nwe spent about 20 minutes getting eaten\nby midges because it was like super\nmidgey faffing about with this wheel but\nobviously at this point I was like I\njust want to be able to actually ride\nand finish because it was a bit like the\nscenery was amazing and like the gravel\nwe literally had 10k of this 113k route\nthat was on road like the rest of it was\nall gravel which is really cool and\nyou're just off in the middle of nowhere\nlike in these like Scottish Highlands I\ndon't know if they're Highlands but\nwhatever they like they have mountains\nand just yeah amazing scenery so finally\nmanaged to sort that out\nand then I was like I'm still going to\nride hard because I wanted this to be\nlike a hard day out and I actually had\nreally good legs so I'm just gonna keep\nfishing work hard and it's actually\nquite fun because I just kept\nsort of catching people\num I helped a couple of other people\nthat saw stuff on the side because I was\nlike given that my day is over I might\nas well lend some canisters and help\nother people out then managed to just\nget through the rest of it enjoy it and\nit was just a really fun really fun day\nout like definitely want to do some more\nI think some of those longer gravel\nraces I reckon could actually be quite\ngood if like again as long as it's the\nsongs I remember house corner and maybe\nfind tires that\nI don't know if it's necessarily the\ntires like maybe it's a combination of\ntires and ceiling\nbut anyway any big gravel enthusiasts\nover there if you've got tips on tire\nsealant combination let me know yeah the\nrace itself really good root as I said\nepic like just\nthey've just got so much gravel up there\nand it was all like non-technical kind\nof like double track like\nit's too super technical bits I crashed\none no completely mindful there was\nnothing technical\num I can't even blame it on that just\nreally good and again like the they have\nthese like little Tech boxes full of\nspares because I reckon like 50 of\npeople at least punctured because that\nScottish gravel is kind of quite flinty\nand Sharps I think if you just catch the\nwrong bit\nthere's not much you can do so yeah look\nthere's like 1200 people doing it it's\nlike loads of people had like a really\nnice sort of vibe and it's just like a\nreally nice place like people really\nfriendly where we were staying was\namazing like we had this we're like on\nthis Farm maybe 20 minutes away like\nthey were so accommodating we turned\nback up post race obviously me sort of\nlike half covered in blood and they're\nlike do you need some help the host then\nbasically spent five minutes getting\ngravel out of all of my cars and\npatching me up and gave me a beer so\nyeah anyone looking for somewhere nice\nto stay in Scotland let me know because\nthis place was brilliant\nbut yeah just generally really good\nwould like highly recommend it\ndefinitely clean to do it again next\nyear it's good fun yeah hopefully do\nsome more this season it's just fitting\nthem in around triathlons but yeah I\nthink like there's so many out there I\nactually started looking the other day\nand there's like loads like basically\nevery weekend I could probably go do a\ngravel race if I wanted it's just\nfactoring in obviously most of them\ndon't have prize money so it's a kind of\na costly way of going and having some\nfun training rides really Keen to do\nmore I think unfortunately the world\nChamps\nis just poor Kona so that's kind of no\npoint really trying to do that\nbut yeah I think maybe some like late\nseason ones and maybe a couple more in\nthe mid-season as I'm sort of rehabbing\nthe cough"

      "transcript": "Marks and I are in Galloway Forest Park\nand we're looking at some of the route\nfor the grow which has got a new ultra\nversion.\nThe key to any ultra is having enough\nnutrition. [music]\nSo like stuff your pockets full of gels,\nbars, and you just you can't not eat\nenough.\nHeat up here.\n[music]\n&gt;&gt; [music]\n&gt;&gt; I think it's completely achievable for\nfirst time ultra riders, but then it's\nalso demanding enough and has enough\ninterest that I think it's going to be\ngreat for the very experienced of us.\n[music] It's going to be fast. It's It's\nnot going to be a multi-day ultra. It's\ngoing to be just a one long day. But\nyeah, it's pretty spectacular here. And\nyeah, I'm looking forward to doing it in\nsummer.\n&gt;&gt; You hungry, Marcus?\n&gt;&gt; A little bit. What do you fancy? I've\ngot my tuck shop here.\n&gt;&gt; Oh, wait. It's um you choose.\n&gt;&gt; So, I've got like a day note bar\nor a stir bar.\nOr do you want a luch? Have you had luch\nbefore?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a banana leaf energy product.\n[snorts]\n&gt;&gt; This is guava and orange. Shouldn't talk\nwith half a mouthful.\nBut actually on my brand the world trip,\nI love the stuff which is wrapped in\nbanana leaves in um in Thailand.\nI was a bit of a surprise what was\ninside cuz I'm vegetarian.\nSometimes it was meat. [snorts] Most of\nthe times it wasn't.\nThis is nice.\nI guess my\nnutritional tip for the Ultra is um take\nstuff with you've eaten beforehand cuz\nif you're out for 320 kilometers and you\neat something that probably is not your\ntaste, then that's\nnot the greatest feeling in the world.\nUm so take comfort food, stuff you like\nand eat often. Don't leave it for too\nlong. And also, this is nice. Take some\nstuff that reminds you of good times or\nif you got a bit of a slo somewhere. Um,\na nice bit of food goes a long way. Um,\nand that's also nice bit of food.\nSometimes a good reminder of and get\nbetter on the other end. So, no doubt\nit's not going to be an easy ride in the\npark. Any ultra is is quite demanding.\n[snorts] But I think if you if you're in\nthose times where you're dipping a\nlittle bit, have something to lift you\nup again. It's always a good idea.\n&gt;&gt; You want some? [laughter]\n&gt;&gt; I got another one.\n&gt;&gt; They're cool.\nSo that's biod basically.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ah, cool. With X Miles, you can buy just\nsingle items and then you can pick and\nchoose between loads of different brands\nand see what suits you and see what you\nactually like. Find what works best for\nyour gut. As I think everyone's\ndifferent and um you have different\ntastes and different likes and different\nguts,\nright? Should we go to the next part,\nMarcus?\nSo, we're um here in Galloway Forest\nPark and this is where the the Gallic is\ngoing to be staged, the ultra version.\nIt's 330 km and a time limit of 25\nhours, but I reckon\nit's a similar sort of distance as like\nthe Trackr 360. So, I'd say it's about a\n12 13 hour for the fastest finishes, but\nit's a it's a very long day on the bike.\nWhat do you think, Marcus? It's like\nlong, but super scenic. We are just\nbehind in front of a beautiful lock\nhere. Um,\n&gt;&gt; look for everyone who doesn't live in\nScotland is the road for lake. Um, and\nthis is stunning here. Like, it's really\nnice woodland. Uh, super super nice\ngravel roads actually.\n&gt;&gt; They drain really well. Yeah, it's been\nraining all night before we shot this\nand it's pretty much dry on the ground.\nSo, for the riding, it's that's superb.\nUm, and yeah, the scenery is amazing.\nIt's just like this nice change of\nwoodland bits and then you're out on the\nopen and then you've got like some\nmountains like this behind you. I think\nit's that's the nice thing about the\nultra event. You can you can race it or\nyou can have a nice time\n&gt;&gt; nice time and take the full 25 hours and\nlook at beautiful. And this is also, you\nprobably won't be able to see that on\ncamera today, but this is a dark sky\npark. So if you're out here at night, um\nyou'll see the stars and there's no\nlight pollution whatsoever. So look up.\nUm again, cuz kind of referring back a\nlittle bit to my around the world trip,\nI remember I had one night riding to the\njungle of the rainforest in Thailand. Um\nand it's so amazing when you just stop\non the gravel track and look up and look\nlook at the stars and see the trees\nwinding above you. It's pretty cool.\nYeah, fingers crossed for clear skies.\nIt'll be pretty special.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it never rains in Scotland.\n&gt;&gt; No, never rains in Scotland. Don't quote\nme on this,\n&gt;&gt; but I don't think there's any hiker\nbike. I think it's all on uh double\ntrack forest tracks and just fast\nrolling gravel roads. I don't think\nthere's any like any hiking bits.\n&gt;&gt; There's no hiker bike. So, you can ride\nyour bike for 220 kilometers, which is\nwhich is a massive bonus. And the other\nthing about Galloway is so it's really\nhilly here. So you've got some some some\nbig inclines, but they are all fairly\nokay to climb. So you'll have a long\nclimb, but you'll also have a long\ndownhill on the other side. So you spend\nyour energy going up the climb, but you\ncan relax a little bit on the other\nside.\n&gt;&gt; Enjoy the scenery. Look at the amazing\nviews. This is Scotland. As I mentioned,\nthere's hills. Um, it also depends on\nthe weather. So there's also a\npossibility that whatever average you\nwant to ride in an hour might not be the\ncase if you're out on the ground. So\ngive yourself a little bit of a buffer\nas well. Um enjoy the whole thing. I\nthink that's my biggest my biggest like\nit's an experience like treat it as that\nlike it's just such an amazing thing. If\nyou if you haven't done any mega long\nrides, this is a cool environment to do\nit because you've you're in an event you\nwant to finish. Um, so you've got like a\nnatural um, aim to aim for. There's\nother people on the course as well, so I\nthink no doubt you'll bump into other\npeople. There's the foot stops along the\nway. Um, and taking the scenery like I\nI've raced quite a few races and most of\nthem had all of them had amazing scenery\nand that's the kind of thing that's the\nstuff you remember um, in the end. Um,\nand if there's there's also it sounds a\nbit it sounds a bit stereotypical, but\nit's probably there's a lot of truth in\nit. It's like never scratch at night.\nUm, and probably not so much of a race,\nbut basically if you have a low um give\nyourself, you know, if you if you if\nyou're in that very point where you\nthink, oh, I'm going to throw the towel\nin. I'm not going to continue. sit down,\ntake 15 minutes to rest, listen to a\ncool song, talk to someone else, have\nsome nice food, and probably after 15 to\n20 minutes, the world look like a better\nplace, and then just get back on the\nbike and finish the whole thing. Don't\nget intimidated at the start. Don't look\naround at everyone else's gear and\nthink, \"Oh, that bike's better than\nmine, or they've got sprint off the\nstart line.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um because that doesn't matter.\nYou ride whatever you have, what's good\nfor you. And I think that's like that\nwould be my big piece of advice like\njust at the start, you know, be\nprepared, but also kind of like don't\ndon't don't get sucked in into\nsomething. Just it's your race and yeah,\ndon't don't don't go full guns blazing\nout. Um because write try to ride your\nown pace all the time. You know what is\nbest for you. So it's kind of like Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And 330k is a long way at the end of the\nday. So it's going to it's going to be a\nlong long day on the bike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you manage halfway through, if\nyou think you're you're not quick enough\nand you can go a bit further, then go\nfor it. But don't do it right at the\nstart cuz that might not be a good\ndecision."

road to\ncomplete this 60 kilometer loop so i'm\nhere today\nwith paul from criterium\nand\nhis friend steve who's newly acquired a\ngravel bike so he's come out to give it\na test\nand we thought we'd do this lovely\nlovely loop\nnow i've never cycled in dumfries and\ngalloway really so this is all brand new\nto me join me on this windy but sunny\nlovely day as we explore\nthe best kept secret in southern\nscotland\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nso we've just done 10k of nice quiet\nsingle track road and now we're going to\nhead up into the gravel of glen troll\nnow we are going around backwards today\ndue to the headwinds coming from the\nwest so we thought we'd have a nice\ntailwind as we went through the glen\nso yeah\nlet's catch up with the guys and see\nwhat this is all about\nso we're just climbing up into glen\ndrool now\nalong this lovely forest track\nthis is lovely around here\nexcellent part of the world this\nfor me massively underexplored i'm\nsaying to paul this is the first time\ni've ever ridden in dumfries and gallery\nmassive unexplored gem for me around\nhere\nright no sooner we started then we have\nstopped for a coffee\nwe do coffee don't we\nyeah\njust do coffee\nthank you very much steve so i thought\nwell well we're pausing having a coffee\nand ruminating i wanted to ask paul\nabout why he's brought his mountain bike\nto clearly a gravel bike ride yeah yet\nagain yeah talk us through your logic\ni'm too fat and unfit to keep up with\nthese boys on my gravel bike\nand i've not done my gravel bike upgrade\nyet\nso i've got a couple of mods coming to\nthe gravel bike which will gear it\nbetter\nso that's why i brought that back\nbecause it's the only one i can keep up\nwith the end the end\nthe last time we did a bike ride\ntogether you were doing a bit of an\nexperiment about range yeah you doing\nanything like that today yeah so this is\nthe longest ride i'll have done\nthat was 56\nk\nat the time this is about 67 kilometers\nand we were marginal then\nhowever\nbit interesting\nbecause it's much warmer\nwhich does affect range and\nyou remember the trail was a lot\nstickier\nyeah so it was just defrosted at that\npoint and the sort of forest track was\njust really sticky and claggy was\nrolling a lot smoother today so i'm\ninterested to see what range\ndifference you get depending on the\nenvironmental conditions\neven though i'm fatter and fitter you go\ncan technology make up for your\nfitness\nthat's fair enough yeah excellent yeah\nwe'll see how that goes yeah absolutely\nwell yeah\nbut also today we have steve with us now\nsteve\nis a roadie a road bike recently within\nlike the last week yep purchased his\nlovely trek gravel bike which we'll talk\nmore about later but i was might be\ninterested in\nwell how did this come about what\nspurred you on to getting a gravel bike\num i'm an old mountain biker\nat heart and a long time ago so actually\nthe thought of being able to have a bike\nthat gets you access to lots of off-road\nstuff that are old hill tracks is\nactually one of the things that really\nappealed to me getting into more remote\nspots and more wilder spots uh and away\nfrom traffic uh and the roads are so\npoor now anyway actually that there's no\nmuch difference um so i have to say uh\nalthough i'm only a weekend um huge\nconvert versatility fun and comfort\nthose were the three words that i would\nput with with gravel raiding it's\ntotally different\ntotally different from road riding um\nthat doesn't mean it's better or worse\nit's just different and it gives you\nanother style of ride and i'm really\nenjoying it it's interesting so maybe\nit's a bit soon to ask the question but\nit was a sunday and you had a choice to\ngo out on the bike\nwhich one would you take at the moment\nit's too soon to say um\na a fast group ride with your pals it\ncan be beat so\nbut neither can you be you know a day\nlike today where you're just titling\nalong you can go as hard as fast as you\nwant and you can stop for a cup of\ncoffee they're both completely different\nthings which one i'll choose in the\nfuture as i get older slower and fatter\ninevitably maybe the coffee and the\nscone option\nexcellent well we'll see how we get on\nwith the with the rides today we've\nbarely started before we've stopped so i\nthink we're maintaining the tradition of\nhaving a climb after the coffee as well\nup into glen troll i don't care you're\nokay\nsee how we get on\nso you've ridden up the road and we're\nnow at glen trawl itself\nwith the with the lock down there\nso now\nwe get to go into the hills\nlet's go\nso now we're just climbing up through\nthe glen\ni can't help but think that the other\nway is better than this\nit's still rewarding to do\nbut everyone loves going downhill more\nthan uphill\nso far the gravel\ni was a bit bit rugged at the start\nthere and now it's smoothed off into a\nnice small\nregular forest fire road\nso it's quite easy going for the\nclimbing up anyway\nwhich i'm\nvery grateful for\nlook at that waterfall\noh\nso here we are then lochte\nafter climbing out of glen troll we then\ndescended back down this side and that\nwas lovely\nthere was\nthe glen troll stone or stain or\nsomewhere but i think i missed it\num it's part of the seven stains of\nscotland mountain bike trails each\nmountain bike trail in southern scotland\nhas a stain that goes with it stone\nand this one i think has got inscribed\non it and ruins one of the oldest irish\npoems\nbut yeah we missed that so\nlook out for it if you ride this way\nmaybe a bit more observant i was too\nmuch enjoying the descending i think\nbut look at this it's quite windy\nbut the sun's out and the views are\ngreat\nso we both got our bikes from criterium\num this isn't a sponsored ride by the\nway just so happens\nthat we both did i got the bianchi you\ngot the trick tell me about your trick\nuh the key thing was taking our advice\non sizing i wanted to size down from\nthis\nnot really understanding gravel right to\nbe perfectly honest uh so fantastic\nadvice from both keith and paul\nto get this size which is a 61 which\nfits me perfectly and handles really\nreally well so\nyeah um good good advice from from a\nproper professional bike shop makes a\nhuge difference in spending your money\nwisely it's a fantastic break at\ncheckpoint six it's a level up from what\nexpected to buy but it's been well worth\nit beautiful frame progressive geometry\nso it handles really well stable on the\nfast descents a nice short stem which\nkeeps it agile\nnothing much to say really the sram etap\nseems to work really well only a weekend\ni'm not a fan of sram to be honest but\nso far so good so um yeah i'm persuaded\nhere's one for you as a road bike onto\ngravel per mile how much more effort do\nyou think you put in on the gravel as\nopposed to a road\ndefinitely more um\ndon't know how to calculate it and\nactually\npartly that's because there's a million\ndifferent kinds of gravel\nthere's big lumpy horrible stuff that\nrattles the fillings out your teeth and\nyour bones\nand then there's silky smooth stuff\nwhere you just glide over so hard to\ntell\num a huge difference between the wet and\ndry as well\nand depending how much grip and how how\nbrave you are in the descent but yeah\nharder harder work so it's just\ndifferent you don't go as fast\nbut you still can go as hard\nso\ndid you enjoy that paul\nepic\nso that's us descended down now\nwell that was moaning going up glen\ntroll actually coming down the way it\nwas really good\nsix and two threes which way you go\nthere i think\nand now we're just gonna wiggle our way\nalong the back back towards newton\nstewart 30k to go i think and then we're\ndone\nexcellent excellent ride\nthis is a long slog of a climb around\nabout just under 2k long i think\nand it just keeps going\ni think paul's had to drop down\nthe power mode\nto make sure he doesn't run out of\nbattery\nby time we get around\ni feel sorry for him on that one\nit's tough it's a long slog\nso now that we're alone here is\na bit of a confession\ni've been telling paul the distance to\ngo\nas we've been going around\nand he's been calibrating his\nelectric assistance accordingly now what\ni've just realized\nis my distance to destination is\nactually counting up\nso because we're going around backwards\nso i keep telling him it's getting\nlonger and longer\ni didn't actually realize\nsorry paul\ni have a confession what so\nremember i've been telling you how far\nwe've got to go yes and you've been\ncalibrating your\nassistance accordingly yeah well because\nwe're going around backwards\nthe distance to go has been counting up\nso actually i've been telling you longer\ndistances as we've been going around\ndamn you've actually got left and your\nbrain was so tired you didn't figure it\nout\ni am sorry\ni've only just realized hey if you\ncouldn't use you could have a tugboat\nall the way home\ni'm hanging out you will\nto all subscribers\nof rusty rides gravel\nthis guy is the loveliest man on the\nplanet\nbut right now\nis my most revered enemy\nmy legs are absolutely cooked\ni've got enough range left to do another\nlap\naccording to mr lee\ni love you man\ni love you\ni'm sorry you treated\nthree words here there we go you know\nwhat i was just chatting about how cool\nit was to have gravel bikes if you had\nto go two up time trail down that rear\nroad yes yeah that's exactly so i was\njust talking about space correct\nyeah yeah the difference between doing\nthis route on a mountain bike and doing\nit on a gravel bike\nand there's nothing on this route that\nyou couldn't do easily on a gravel bike\nand nothing that's troubled these two\nbikes but with the lower gearing\nof the mountain bike the extra weight\nand of course the cut-off speed of the\nmotor i was cruising down there at sort\nof 16 17 miles an hour quite happy\nhaving a nice time but you guys have\nbeen rocking along at sort of the 20 25\n30 mile an hour\nyeah yeah yeah hi yeah yeah it's nothing\nto do with you yeah yeah um but yeah\nit's it's one of those things that you\nguys are having a nice time i'm having a\nnice time yes perfect if you want to go\nthe fastest route round here definitely\non a gravel bike particularly if you've\ngot the fitness and the strength to be\nable to do it on your own if you don't\nand the thought of doing this mileage\nand this amount of climbing\nif you're quite new into cycling and\nyou're not massively fit\nthen doing it slightly slower on an\nelectric mounting bike it's going to be\nmore comfortable it's going to be less\npunishing on the body yeah\nbut also it's going to help you on those\nbigger longer drags yeah there you go\nconsumer advice\nhere on rusty rides gravel i mean\nthere's nothing more for me to say there\nwe go there we go sum up the route\nexcellent route love it yes really like\nthis little glen troll big country loop\nbig country loop big secret scotland\nfigure secret\ni highly recommend you come here go\neither way clockwise or counter\nclockwise yeah it seems to be great\neither way yep happy with that yep yeah\nso we just got a bit of road work to\npeople back yep and then we'll put our\nfeet up\nwell you will i will you're driving i'm\ndriving\n[Laughter]\nbrilliant thanks for watching everyone\nhope you enjoy the ride don't forget to\nlike subscribe to rusty rides gravel and\npaul's channel links into things oh yeah\nyeah yeah criterium cycles we've got\nchannels as well they they do things\nabout bikes i've heard yeah absolutely\nyeah ask for keith that's awesome\ndefinitely\ngood right enough cut\nand we're back\nwhat's that rusty looking pretty dapper\nthere with your hat on yeah i know yeah\nthanks for noticing merch rusty rides\ngravel\njust go to the shop buy your own\nso we've got a new feature for the end\nof the ride\nwe're going to call it\nrusty's recommendations\nthanks to stevie for the for the\nsuggestion what are the three things\nthat you need to do to make this ride a\nsuccess\nand we thought\ncoffee definitely stopped for coffee\nthere's two's potential stops you can\nstop at the bike center at glen troll or\ncut over to clattering shores so\ndefinitely make the time for that\nlook at the wind direction when you're\ngoing through glen draw headwind is\ngoing to be the big problem so go in the\ndirection that gives you a tailwind\nand we also thought probably parking\nmake sure you're parking at a reasonable\nplace that you want to start and stop\nfrom don't start with a big hill or end\nwith a big hill that would be my\nrecommendation so there you go follow\nthose and you're going to have a great\nday out but yeah great ride great ride\ngreat company great day out\nlove this part of the world i'm\ndefinitely coming back\namazing ride this if you can see you\nlater everyone\nyou"
