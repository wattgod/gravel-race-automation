      "description": "I rode my ebike in the (Almost) Anything Goes category of the GRiT Gravel Adventure Ride on the 63-mile Maximus course at Snoqualmie Pass, WA.  There were four major climbs and the last was a beast.\n\nOverall 211 people competed in this timed event, with 69 doing the Maximus, the longest course in the series.  The event had amazing support, including traffic control on the paved roads and an outstanding and well staffed and stocked aide station that we were routed past three times.\n\nI did crash on downhill #3, but after a consult with the event medic I decided to keep going for another 24 miles and I think it helped the swelling on my knee go down.\n\nOverall it was a great ride, very well organized and supported.\n\nI rode my Biktrix Juggernaut FS Pro 3 with dual 52v batteries (17.5Ah main + 17Ah extender) and finished with about 16% remaining.\n\nThe GRiT\nhttps://thegrit.bike/\n\nResults\nhttps://www.webscorer.com/race?raceid=359169\n\nBiktrix\nhttps://www.biktrix.com/\n\n#Grit #Biktrix #ebike #gravelbike  #snoqualmie \n\n0:00 Start\n0:30 We meet again\n0:48 Start of climb 1\n1:03 near top of climb 1\n1:15 Fast downhill 1\n2:03 Fat Tires\n2:15 Traffic support\n2:26 Drafting assist\n2:54 Lake Keechelus\n3:08 Aide station\n3:34 Start of climb 2\n3:46 Climb 2 is rough\n3:58 Wash out\n4:09 Fast downhill 2\n4:39 Sketchy climb 3\n4:52 Sketchiness\n5:06 Downhill 3\n6:24 Reckless abandon\n6:40 CRASH\n7:21 assess damage\n8:23 Medic consult\n9:48 Keep going\n10:16 Lake Kechess\n10:26 Climb 4\n10:36 Encouragement\n10:48 False summit\n10:56 Are we there yet?\n11:06 Finally at the top!\n11:16 Fast downhill 4\n11:29 Amazing views\n11:40 Almost there\n11:50 The finish line!",

      "description": "The GRiT Gravel Adventure ride is a 60+ mile timed ride event through the mountains above Snoqualmie Pass, WA.  Some of the terrain can be pretty treacherous as I encountered in this clip.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill I consulted with the event medic, and despite a golf ball sized hematoma on my knee he cleared me to continue, and over the next 24 miles it actually worked it self down so it wasn't as bad by the time I drove home.  I was still pretty stiff and sore, and I had to order a new rear rack because the crash snapped the one I had.\n\nOverall it was a fun ride, despite this incident, and it was very well supported.

      "transcript": "Shopping for road bike tires is easy.\nThere are just three steps. Step one,\nyou go to bicycle rollingresistant.com.\nYou look up what the fastest tires are.\nStep two, you Google, you chose a model,\nand you look for a good price. Step\nthree, you click buy. That's it. Simple,\neasy peasy. Now, sure, there are other\nthings like puncture resistance, grip,\nweight, so on. But let's face it, these\ndays, most allrounder racing tires from\nthe big names are pretty similar, and\nyou can't really go too far wrong. But\nshopping for gravel bike tires, not so\neasy. Yeah, you can go online and look\nup what the fastest gravel bike tires\nare, but then you start thinking, hm,\nthat tire looks a lot like a big road\ntire. Is it really a gravel tire? Won't\nI need some tread for grip when you're\nriding off road? Well, today I'm going\nto tell you.\n[Music]\nThese are Hutchinson's Caracal Race TLR\ntires, and they cost \u00a354.99\nper tire. Now, if you go to bicycle\nrollingresistance.com, you'll see that\nthese are currently listed as the fourth\nfastest tire in the CX/ravel\ncategory. And if you look a little bit\ncloser, you'll realize that the three\nfaster tires aren't really gravel tires\nat all. They're just slicks. Now,\nHutchinson's Caracle Race is the most\nefficient gravel tire with a tread of at\nleast 1 mm on the shoulders. But is it\nany good, though? Is that actually\nenough grip? And is it actually tough\nenough to use as a gravel tire? Well,\nI've been using this and its tougher and\nmuch slower sibling, the Caracle TLR,\nfor a while now, and I've got some\nconclusions. I also think they raise\nsome really interesting questions about\nhow we think about gravel riding and how\nwe should set up our bikes for it.\nFirst of all, yes, these are really fast\ngravel tires, and you can feel that\nimmediately, where most gravel tires\ntend to feel pretty draggy on the road,\nespecially if you're coming off a road\nbike with racy tires like Conti GP5000s,\nfor example. These, though, don't feel\nfar off a proper road tire on the road,\nyet they're capable of floating over\nbroken tarmac, hard pack dirt roads, and\nso on. And really that shouldn't be a\nsurprise as according to the lab data,\nthese are actually faster than 38 mm\nShawby Pro ones, which is a proper road\nracing tire with a completely slick\ntread. Of course, at around 470 g each,\nthese tires do add a decent chunk of\nweight to a bike compared to 28s or the\n30s that most of us run on road bikes\nthese days. And yes, that is going to\nmake you fractionally slower on the\nclimbs. However, we're all grown up\nenough to know that that just comes with\nthe territory. If you want bigger tires\nso that you can get more grip and lower\nroll resistance off-road, then that\ninevitably means more material and more\nweight. That's just how it goes. There\nis of course an argument to be had about\nhow much tire volume you actually need,\nbut that's a topic for another video.\nNow, in terms of puncture resistance, I\nthink it's fair to say that these tires,\nlike most at the racy end of this\nspectrum, aren't going to be performing\nmiracles. Now, I've not suffered any\npunctures with either model so far, but\nas a relatively lightweight rider, I'm\nalso a bit easier on my kit than many\nriders, and I've been running inserts to\nguard against pinch flats. Of course,\nit's possible that I've simply been\nlucky, too, but nevertheless, I think if\nyou treat them well, then they will hold\nup okay.\nAll right, so far so good. These sound\nlike they're everything they're cracked\nup to be, right? Well, in a sense, yeah,\nif the conditions suit these tires, then\nI think they're fantastic. Hutchinson\neven recently announced a 45mimeter\nversion will be available from June this\nyear, which is great as these 40mm\nversions are starting to feel relatively\nnarrow by modern gravel standards.\nInevitably though, there are some\ntrade-offs. Part of what makes these\ntires so fast on the road is the slick\ncentral section and minimalist tread on\nthe shoulders, but that can come back to\nbite you off-road if the conditions get\ntricky. When things get loose or worse,\nwet and muddy, then these tires simply\ndo not bite into the trail, you will run\nout of grip extremely quickly.\nAnd this is where we come to the crux of\nthe issue with gravel tires. Is it fair\nto criticize the Caracle Race for not\nbeing good as something it's not\ndesigned to do? Now, this is a race tire\ndesigned for dry conditions rather than\nan all rounder after all. So, you could\nargue that it's not unexpected that it\ntrades grip for speed. That's simply\npart of the calculation. The problem is\nthat gravel can mean so many different\nthings and what constitutes a gravel\nride can be even more varied. Now, where\nI live in South Bristol, even piecing\ntogether every farm track and byway that\nI can find still leaves me with roots\ntotaling at least around 50% tarmac\nroads and typically far more. Now, in\nthose scenarios, even if the trails are\nfairly loose or rocky, then I don't want\nslower, grippier tires that are going to\nfeel rubbish for the vast majority of my\nrides just because they're perfect for\nthe toughest off-road sections. Now, on\nthe other hand, if you're gearing up for\nUnbound Kansas, which is almost all\noff-road, then it's unlikely that you're\ngoing to be served by something that's\nessentially an extra-lar road tire. Now,\nfor terrain like that, it's starting to\nlook like you might want a set of\ncrosscountry mountain bike tires,\nassuming your bike can fit them, of\ncourse. The reality is that there's no\none perfect gravel tire that can do\nalmost everything in the same way a\nConti GP5000 or Victoria Corsera Pro can\ndo on a road bike. All else being equal,\nnarrower gravel tires with less tread\ntend to be faster on the tarmac because\nthey're lighter, bit more arrow, and you\nsimply don't need as much tire volume to\ndeal with bumps in the road. Off-road\nthough, bigger tires can be faster\nbecause they're better able to absorb\nimperfections in the trail. And if you\nswap up to fast XC mountain bike tires\ncan be made with thinner casings so that\nthey have even lower rolling resistance.\nAnd deciding which way to go really\ndepends on where you're going to be\nriding. If you really care about\noptimizing your bike setup, then you're\ngoing to need to change your times every\ntime you ride a substantially different\nroute or more likely be prepared to\ncompromise on something. Now, in my\ncase, I actually think these tires offer\na great balance of the characteristics\nfor the kind of gravel riding that I do.\nI've definitely had some sketchy moments\nwhen using these on wet or loose trails,\nbut for the mostly dry days, the\ntrade-off feels well worth it. But what\ndo you think? Is rolling resistance the\nbe all and end all for gravel bike\ntires, or is it better to go for\nsomething that offers a better balance\nof speed and grip? Or should we really\nall be using XC mountain bike tires on\nour gravel bikes all of the time? As\nalways, let me know your thoughts in the\ncomments below. And if you liked this\nvideo, why not watch this one where we\nreveal the real differences between a\n$1,200 and $12,000 gravel bike."
