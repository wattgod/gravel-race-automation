      "transcript": "today we find ourselves in the small\nMountain Village of Mount Shasta in\nsearch for the perfect party to race\nratio known only as grindero\n[Music]\nwhile there is camping at the event we\nopted for the soft Landing that is Lodge\nDrew what's going on here\nI'm on vacation\nthis is why we Lodge\nit's cold we didn't sleep well Drew's on\na borrowed bike\nwhat could possibly go right\nhey Mike what's your perfect party to\nrace ratio race 60 party 40. one party\nthe three race I like half and half\nwe're a 100 party and one of the coolest\nthings about this event is they feed you\nbreakfast lunch and dinner\njust over 700 of these crazy folks\nlook Becker here yo changing some Focus\nsettings here\nare you kidding me one of the things\nthat's so cool about grindero is that\nthere are four time segments throughout\nthe whole ride or Race So until you get\nto those segments you do not have to\nrace you can just ride the ride and each\nsegment is completely different from the\nnext there's a road time trial a gravel\ndescent a gravel climb and a single\ntrack section so no matter what bike you\nhave you have brought the wrong bike\n[Laughter]\nDrew what's the game plan are we trying\nfor these segments are we just like\ndoing the thing we're just doing the\nthing okay yeah\ndoing the thing\nalso grind hero notoriously Dusty\nturn up that atmosphere\nhey Drew hey Dustin hey tell me about\nyour bike oh I'm glad you asked this is\nuh Canyon Grizzle grinduro purple it's\naluminum heavy heavy wheels and the\nprice is right at 2000 I hear\nit's working out\n[Applause]\nGalvin long time no see long time no see\nhey tell me about your bike this is a 99\nKlein I believe I'm fitted with a\nmodern Parts on a vintage bike what size\ntires you're running I think 2.1's on uh\n26.\nis it triple uh go one by\ndamn in disguise\ntoo soon for you too soon\nall right segment one dirt descent\nI'm definitely nervous\nI don't think I'm gonna go all out\nGod Save the Queen here we go\noh I'm getting tired this section is\nkind of long\nhow was that fun\nfirst segment down the vibe is settled\ninto the ride some people are going a\nlittle more chill some people are taking\nit a little serious\neveryone's finding their Rhythm how's\nyour Rhythm Drew uh a little loose\noh oh that's just the headset\nsnack stop\nthey've got a very busy bike support\nthere's alcoholic drinks I think there's\nbacon food watermelon everybody's\nconfused nobody knows where they're\ngoing\nhey Albert what's your perfect party to\nrace ratio\nI would say grindero a solid 95 to 5 95\nParty come here it's awesome the riding\nis amazing Rory tell me about your bike\nit's a discontinued unfortunately salsa\nPowder Keg put some SRAM axis with some\nof the Shimano Saint downhill breaks and\nsome velocity rims made in America\nkeeping it non-carbon on this bike but\nyeah we're stoked probably a smart move\nyeah\n29 by 2.4 is the tire selection for\ntoday\nGene\nyou\n30 miles in 3 000 feet what's your\nstatus\nstarting to get a little cracked out\nwe're roughly halfway temperature\nholding it a steady 90 degrees I'm a\nlittle more spent than I expected\nI am going to complete it I may or may\nnot enjoy it\nand let's see what happens\nwe found the perfect lone layer Trail\nhere in Mount Shasta California\nright around Lake Siskiyou\nit's a perfect pedestrian party path oh\nthere's lunch yes\nuh how many bikes do you own four I'm\nlike well six I'll be honest six all\nfueled up ready to go even though we're\nactually kind of like tired now and our\nlegs are achy\nI guess we'll keep going Road stage two\nno one's looking forward to this\nall right the plan is for Drew and I to\nPace line we're switching off every\nminute\nthis does\nwe lost Drew I'm gonna try to Soldier on\nfor the good of all mankind\nI was done\nnow the trick is to make sure I don't\ncompletely deplete myself before the\nnext two stages and the third one I\nfancy myself like\na mid-level contender for\nfor the middle\nI think I can land right in there\nnice and nice and soft in the middle\noh yeah I went with the dco today I've\njust been through the most stuff with it\nso whatever this is gonna dish at me I\nmay not enjoy it but I will be able to\nstruggle through it\nthanks to my familiar whip\nthe old dco\nlove you buddy Shameless plug this is\nthe last year villier's gonna offer the\nyena with the dco colorway that I made\nit's like a decline colorway a little\ncommotion camo so if you want one now\nmight be the time and if you don't keep\ndoing what you're doing\nhow many hours or miles do you ride a\nweek\nabout a hundred Hunter Mountain rival\nRoad for hold spring it's amazing\nwelcome to Brian Daryl back on the\nchunder we got like a budget alternative\nversion of pre-cool caps\noh that is just right\nall right 500 meters to The Climb\nDrew's gonna lead it out I'm gonna have\na horrible day tomorrow for this climb\ning\noh my God 500 meters oh it's so hard I\nfeel like puking\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\noh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] will I puke let's find out\nhey Chris what's your perfect party to\n17. how many bikes do you own three how\nmany miles or hours do you ride a week\n17.\nthis climb is kind of a\ndignity killer\nlast three quarters of the Bride\nchunky steep\nwhat do we got for temperature eleven\npercent grade a hundred even for the\ntemperature\nyeah take that morale\nwe'll see you back at the car\neveryone's hiding in the shade\nproud of you guys\nhere we go\nholy cow chunderish\noh boy\nwhat's going on Drew I'm in a world of\nhurt\nI'm all right though I'm good I'm okay\nI'm fine\nI'm out of water\nsnag attack number four\nright on time check it out there's a\nspinner with an armada cool\nbut you're looking kind of salty yeah\nholy Halloween trick or treat yeah get\nin here this seems like the best worst\nidea I've had all day Gene what's the\nI have more dust in my lungs than on the\nground\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whack\nwe're back on the ramble ribbon this\nstuff back here is so dope\nthis last little quarter people are\ngetting a little wrung out it's been a\nlong day it's been very hot a lot of\ndust in the lungs\na lot of miles in the legs\nbut the vibe is high\nand the mood is right so I think the\nplan is to take Whatchamacallit to\ndangle bomb and end up on Close\nEncounters\nwhoa\nthis white stuff sketch it moves in all\nkinds of weird directions\nit's like volcanic pumice and it is not\nfun to ride a bike on\nnext section here we go\nmatch oh man we're doing it last section\nflowing grinding dying pushing\nholy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\none back on you here\nthank you\nthis section is roaring but it would not\nbe anywhere near as possible without a\ndropper dropper is key for this stuff\nthis is a full day and it's still\nhappening\noh it's so soft in the front Oh my legs\nare burning my head is throbbing my\nlungs hurt this yeah\nholy crap I might be better think single\ntrack than I thought\ndude the flow is good back here\nyield up and over\neveryone's worn out bikes are creaking\nwe're tired we're kind of over it but\nwe're still having one of the best times\nwe can imagine having on a bike\nI'm just saying are we having fun yet\nawesome\nthe flowers are a nice touch one last 12\nslap in the face yeah yeah character\nbuilding all that crap how do you guys\nfeeling about Grandeur with this moment\nkiller oh\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it epic but painful\nwe'll be back next year another two with\nall three\noh\nyeah the stick is charred off I'm gonna\nregret this\nhow are you guys feeling absolutely\ncorrect\nthere's a lot going on in their groom\nI'm like Beyond [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it right\nwe came we fought it conquered by who's\nthe most fracked up person you've seen\nthe upper mid pack\nDaddy's happy\nhere's to a successful Mission this is\nhow we Lodge grindero what can I say all\nencompassing all the snacks and all the\nVibes I'm definitely tired I can even\nhear it but I didn't crack and I'm\nI'm proud of that\nthere were definitely a lot of people\nwho did crack and if you don't want to\nwait till next year to ride this exact\nsame course the route's already online\nand I suggest staying at the lodge base\nenough out of a soft Landing for a big\nday on the mountain or just wait till\nnext year and do it with 1 000 of your\nclosest friends\nwhy we launched\nride by the Numbers five hours 51\nminutes rolling Time\n65.25 Miles and\n677 feet of elevation\nit's kind of tough and I think I just\ndeleted the activity from my device\nthat was a proper session but now I\nreluctantly suggest that you check out\nthe last time I went to grindero several\nyears ago\nand enjoy that embarrassing editing\nstyle and storytelling in fact if you\ncan make it through the whole thing\nI'll give you a free\nforeign"

With this being so close to home and on terrain with short to medium punchy climbs that suits my riding style so well, It's safe to say this was the race I was most excited for all season.\n\nSPOILER ALERT HERE: Everything was going perfect to plan, right on Pete and Alexey up the first 4 climbs, and even off the front for a small bit after climb number 4. Then, disaster. I dropped a bottle in Aid 2 and thought I could stop to grab it, but the bottle had exploded. The 7 seconds of stopping time I had here to get another one was Amplified by the fact that it was on a DH and the defending champ was attacking through it, and by the time I got going again it was too late.\n\nSo much \"would have, could have, should have\" with this one, but I will take from this knowlege to learn and grow, as we can often find more growth in our failures than in our successes. \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Strava File: https://www.strava.com/activities/15881801429\n_________________________________________\n\nWant to SUPPORT OUR CHANNEL?

      "description": "Benny is proudly consigned to the 2025 Cowgirl Cadillacs horse sale in Sheridan, Wyoming. \n\nBenny\n2018 Pinto x Draft Gelding\n\nBenny was born and raised in Canada\u2019s ranching and farming heartland. He had excellent upbringing and training which exposed him to many experiences and resulted in a very well rounded horse. He is an irreplaceable partner for all the ranch tasks - moving cattle, sorting, doctoring, branding, shooting varmints, you name it. He is a gentleman on the job - no spook, no worries, no fuss. Through mud bogs and down gravel roads, on cattle drives, and trips to the mountains, benny is sure footed, steady, and confident. He\u2019s not bothered by traffic or machinery and can safely be ridden in those circumstances that can make many other horses uncomfortable. He stays broke no matter how often you ride and he is there when you need him, whether it\u2019s a ride for pleasure or a full day of work on the ranch. He is safe, responsive and very well broke. He is perfect to ride out alone or with others and is also harness broke to drive single! \n\nBenny has a solid foundation in the arena. He stops, spins, changes leads, and understands leg aids well. He\u2019s happy to do arena work and is very handy on a cow. He is light to the aids and could easily be enjoyed in events like team sorting, penning, gymkhana, working equitation, or cowboy challenge.\n\nBenny\u2019s gentle, unflappable disposition also makes him the mount of choice when it comes time to teach the next generation to ride. He happily wears english tack and jumps around the ring, tolerating the young rider\u2019s mistakes and helping them gain confidence in the saddle. He can be ridden bareback, backwards, double, in a halter, or with a neck rope. He is a perfect mount for a young rider to grow up with, whether they wants to ride for ribbons or ride for adventures on the ranch. He is affectionate but has good manners and is gentle with little ones.  \n\nHaving had Benny in my program, I truly feel proud to be offering him at Cowgirl Cadillacs. He is a phenomenal little horse, one of my favourites, and will be greatly missed. Though I know he will make someone very happy and will be the best partner for many years to come.",
