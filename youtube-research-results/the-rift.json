      "description": "The Rift is an off-road bike race through the dark lava fields in the highlands of Iceland. It traverses the continental rift between North America and Eurasia - a rift that grow one inch every year. The growth is evident with vast lava fields all around creating a surreal landscape. A landscape that is remote, rugged and unpredictable. \nThe course starts out of a small town along the southern coast called Hvolsv\u00f6llur. This incredible shoreline stretches from the greater Reykjav\u00edk area in the west to the magnificent J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n glacier lagoon in the east and is lined with countless natural wonders such as cascading waterfalls, volcanoes, black sand beaches and glaciers. \n\nThe route circumnavigates one of the most active volcanoes on the island, Mt. Hekla. \n\nLearn more about the race at: https://www.therift.bike\n\nCinematography & Editing: \nSnorri \u00de\u00f3r Tryggvason\n\nModels: \nGu\u00f0berg Bj\u00f6rnsson\nBergur Benediktsson\n\nMusic: \nSouthern Rock - Midnight Blue Music",

      "description": "Not every story goes the way we want\u2014and this is one of those stories. I traveled all the way to Iceland to race The Rift 200K: one of the most remote, stunning, and brutal gravel races in the world. But from flight delays to fatigue, things didn\u2019t unfold like I hoped. And maybe\u2026 that\u2019s the point.\n\nThis video isn\u2019t about the finish line. It\u2019s about the ride. The terrain. The struggle. The unexpected beauty. The mental battle. The small moments that made it worth it anyway. I didn\u2019t walk away with a PR or a big result\u2014but I did walk away with a renewed mind.\n\nBefore the race, I wrote four words on my number plate:\n\u201cHave fun. Thank God.\u201d\nThose words carried me through, and they still do.\n\nIn this video:\n\ud83c\udf0b The full Rift 200K breakdown\n\ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Raw Icelandic highlands and race footage (full raw footage on channel)\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f A real, honest story of what happens when a big race doesn\u2019t go to plan\n\ud83d\udccdNo perfect ending. Just the journey.\n\n\ud83d\udccd About The Rift 200K:\nThe Rift is a 200km gravel race through the black lava fields and wild highlands of Hvolsv\u00f6llur, Iceland. Featuring everything from fast rolling roads to glacial river crossings, volcanic climbs, and relentless winds, it\u2019s one of the most scenic and savage races on the planet.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Comment below: Have you ever had a race (or trip) that didn\u2019t go to plan but still left an impact?

      "transcript": "We all come to races like this hoping\nfor the perfect story, the clean\nbuildup, the peak form, the triumphant\nfinish. But sometimes the story doesn't\ngo that way.\n[Music]\nSometimes the plane turns around\nmid-flight.\nSometimes the legs don't show up.\nAnd sometimes the race that you trained\nmonths for becomes something else\nentirely\n[Applause]\nat the rift. I didn't get to race the\nway that I had planned. I didn't get to\nmake the film that I had laid out for\nmonths. But maybe that's the point. Some\ndays aren't about performance. They're\nabout letting go and about finding joy\nin the unexpected.\nFinding joy not in something that we\nhave built up ourselves, but finding joy\nin the simple beauty of God's creation.\nThis isn't the story I thought I'd tell,\nbut it certainly is still a good one.\nHeat.\nWell, just an explosive morning in\nIceland as a volcano erupted in the\nsouthwest part of the country. Here is\nvideo from this outbreak near Iceland's\ncapital, which has seen an increase in\nactivity over the last few years.\nOfficials say while this is a small\neruption, people have been evacuated\nfrom the Blue Lagoon. It's a popular spa\nresort that you may have heard of or\neven been to.\nThere's so many carrots in Heat up\nhere.\nWe finally made it.\nCrazy drive up to the race town. Crazy\ntravel.\nI'm exhausted, but we've got a ride in a\nlittle bit, so we got to get this thing\nbuilt.\nfrom like Unbound, I guess.\nSo, I'm like I'm like I'm going to have\nto order some dubnitoalls like next\nweek. Yeah, there's a bunch of them.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's like it just looks really\nbad, but I don't think it's actually\nlike past the casing cuz otherwise there\nbe otherwise they'd be flat. Yeah,\nexactly.\n&gt;&gt; This is the same tire I flatted last\nweek.\nJust wanted to take a quick second to\nthank La Cycles, our bike sponsor, for\nputting us up here. We were staying\nright there right near the start, which\nwas super awesome. So, big thanks to\nthem.\nYeah, probably not for the whole thing.\nAll right, so let's recap the story so\nfar. So far, we have tried to fly into\nIceland. We've gotten turned around on a\nflight to Iceland. We got a few nights\nof bad sleep in between all that. Then\nwe finally got to Iceland. And now we've\nbeen here for a total of about 4 hours.\nWe've done one pre-ride, not even on the\ncourse, so we have no idea what that\nlooks like. We only have a little bit of\ntime before we have to go to sleep to\nwake up at a reasonable time for the\nrace. We are close to the start, which\nis a perk, but that doesn't help with\nthe fact that our rice cooker caught on\nfire. I have no dinner. Nah, my manager,\ngave me some rice. Shout out to Nina. I\nbought an avocado at the store. We\ncouldn't read what was different about\nthe avocado. There was one avocado that\nwas $200, one that was $800, and\napparently the $200 avocados stay green\nuntil the next morning and aren't even\nthat brown after the race the next day.\nSo definitely buy the $200 avocados.\nSo with all that in mind, we have about\none night of bad sleep left to get\nbefore the start in the morning. going\ninto this, not knowing how the legs will\nreact after such a chaotic week and not\nknowing where my mind will be after such\na stressful week.\nSo, as you can tell, it was raining on\nrace morning, which left me a bit of a\ndilemma as to what to wear. I went with\na bit of an unconventional option with\nshorts and a winter jacket. I knew that\nit was going to be colder once we got up\ninto the highlands, so I didn't want to\nbe cold, but I also didn't want to be\ntoo hot, so I went with this combo\nknowing that I could unzip the jacket to\ncool off. There will be links in the\ndescription to all of this gear. Thank\nyou so much to all of our sponsors who\nmake this possible.\n&gt;&gt; And to tell you the truth, there are\ntimes\nThree, two, one. Unleash the beat.\nSo, as we started off here, I decided\nthat I might as well go out fast and see\nwhat I did have in the legs. Knowing\nthat I probably wouldn't have much, I\nthought it'd still be fun to see how far\nI could make it with this front group. I\nlike this format of start where we all\nstart together, the pros and the\namateurs. It makes it fun.\nWhen editing this, I wrote a whole\nscript explaining this route, but I kept\nrewriting it. And every time I rewrote\nit, I realized that there's not much I\ncan do to explain what this course is. I\ncan tell you how bumpy all the rocks\nwere. And I can tell you how long it\nfelt, even though it was only 200 km. I\ncan tell you how I think it was harder\nthan Unbound, but ultimately I don't\nthink any of that comes close to seeing\nit for yourself.\nI can only hope that this video can\ncommunicate some of the beauty of this\nroute, but I would certainly encourage\nanyone that wants to see it more to go\nbuy a plane ticket to Iceland right now.\nIt's definitely worth it.\nSo, with that said, I'll let this route\nspeak for itself.\nHeat. Heat.\nHeat\nup here.\nup\nHeat up\nSo, at this point, I am about halfway\nthrough, and on paper, it looks like all\nI have to do now is make it a little bit\nfurther until the final climb, which\nlooks pretty smooth on the profile.\nwhile and then do this one final climb\nand then the last 30 mi should be\ndownhill.\nBut because of how steep this next climb\nwas and because of how rough all of the\ndescending is, it took me almost 2 hours\nlonger coming back than it did going\nout.\nI am still having a lot of fun though.\nYeah.\nEasily just as hard or harder than\nunbound.\n&gt;&gt; I've done unbound. This is hard.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did unbound this year.\n&gt;&gt; I did last year.\nUnbound. Ground was in pretty good\nshape.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nJumping in one more time here to just\nacknowledge the fact that I am riding my\nbike on a volcano right now. I never\nthought that I would say that, but I am\nriding my bike on a volcano for the\nsecond time this year because I climbed\nHolly in January. So yeah, bikes on\nvolcanoes. We can do that now.\nThere was a finish line out there\nsomewhere, but that's not where the\nstory ends.\nBecause the most meaningful miles aren't\nthe ones at the end. They're the ones\nwhere you wanted to quit and didn't.\nWhere everything hurt, but the view made\nyou smile. Where you remembered why you\ncame in the first place.\nNo, this race was not the perfect race,\nbut it was real. And sometimes\nthat's enough.\nLet me leave you with the four words\nthat I wrote on my number plate. The\nonly four words that I needed to\nremember on this day.\nHave fun.\nThank God."
