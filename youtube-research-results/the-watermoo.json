      "transcript": "[Music]\nso STDs went to the water move the water\nmove takes place uh starts and ends in\nDexter\nMichigan and if you're wondering if this\nought to be a race that you put on your\nschedule uh quite simply yes this is a\nvery good event\nso when you're picking an event to go to\nuh I know for me there's a few things\nthat I look for I want to have a nice\nplace to ride a bike I want a really\ngood route I want the uh scenery to be\nsomething that's fun to look at and it\ndoesn't have to be totally different\nfrom where I live I just want it to be\nsomething that is going to be enjoyable\nto be spending your time you're going to\nbe hours on a bike so I want to be able\nto see things that are Pleasant to be\naround I want to make sure that the\nevent is run very well so\nand you know location is a big part of\nthat how they run their event who's the\nthe Staffing everybody has a part to\nplay in that and this one checked off a\nlot of things for me for 110 mile race\nyou're not looking at Uber elevation you\nknow it's it's plenty of elevation but\nit's not too much so when you're coming\nfrom a place where I live it's fairly\nflat it's not intimidating if you're\nlooking for to do a 100 mile\nevent um the water Mo can be huge I mean\nit really has the potential to be an\nenormous race I would just absolutely\nencourage people to go because it has\nthose things that will allow it to\ngrow where you park um they at the uh\nJolly\nPumpkin we didn't try the beers but uh\nhad dinner it was really\ngood there speed Ro so you have plenty\nof space right there at the event to\nfind a parking space and you're not\nhaving to travel a long way um but\nreally close to where the start finish\nis is a school which has a huge parking\nlot so they have ample Room to Grow I\nmean I've we've been to a couple places\nto where they don't have parking and you\nthink okay it's not that big a deal but\nthere are issues when you don't have\nplaces to park we were at an event in\nMichigan and I don't want to say\nanything bad about them because so much\nof what they had was fantastic but there\njust wasn't parking available and it's\nbeen a couple years maybe they have um\nbrokered a deal with a farmer and can\nuse a field something I don't know but\nwhen we were at at that event somebody\ncrashed a bike we had to go pick him up\nand then by the time we came back there\nwas no parking anywhere\nnear if you're on a bicycle and you're\npark your car get your bike out ride to\nthe start finish if it's a mile away\nthat's not that big a deal if it's a\nmile and a half it's not that big a deal\nbut if somebody crashes they have a\nbroken bike you go pick them up and then\nyou have to park a mile and a half away\nyou've just added 40 minutes of walking\ntime to get back and it just it it's one\nof those things that man if you've got\nthe right location that you have parking\nyou have amenities it's it's a it's a\nleg up on other people and the water\nmove has\nthat they also have a very good route um\nyou know honestly in my opinion the best\nway to do these is on an SDS Crusader\nbut that's my very biased opinion but\nyou go off the PVE Road onto the gravel\nand it's just smooth as can be it's it's\nfantastic on a gravel but on I'm sorry\non an STS Crusader on an STS Grabel bike\nit's\nabsolutely absolutely fantastic and then\nyou start getting some challenges early\non so the hills are are are there there\nare some climbs but it's rolling kills\nit's just absolutely fantastic\nI was on slicks for the event Josh was\non\num The American Classic gr and so had a\nlittle bit of naughtiness to his tires\nbut uh a variety of tires would work\ncan't say enough about the water moo I\nwill say this that if you're looking for\n100 Mile Challenge it's 110 there's\ninteresting things there it's beautiful\nscenery there's a water crossing which\nadds a little bit of\nintrigue I would I would absolutely say\nthis is a great event to Che choose for\nthat 100 Mile Challenge if that's\nsomething that you're looking for and if\nyou're looking for a place to go race\nand you want to see um something cool\ncome check out the water move I will\ntell you this though STS Crusader is the\nway to go i' come get one of those\nbefore you go next year you got plenty\nof time"
