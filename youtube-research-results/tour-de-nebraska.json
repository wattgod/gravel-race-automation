      "description": "This Department of Interior film captures Boulder Dam \u2014 better known as Hoover Dam \u2014 in the midst of its construction. See how the Colorado River flowed before, and after, the construction of what was then the world's tallest dam.  \n\nSUMMARY\nPart 1 shows the Colorado River and the arid deserts of the Southwest. Bulldozers build a road to the proposed dam site. A train brings in supplies and materials made throughout the U.S. The dam site is surveyed. Shows Boulder City, Nev., including workmen's dormitories, kitchen, and mess hall. Workers ride to the dam site in trucks and drill and blast out diversion tunnels. Power shovels clear debris. In part 2, diversion tunnels are blasted open and coffer dams are constructed. Bulldozers and trucks clear excavated material. Sand and gravel is brought in by train and is screened, washed, and graded. Concrete is mixed and is carried by truck and locomotive to the dam site. In part 3, concrete is poured into forms. Shows the interior of a tunnel, the intake towers, spillways, and penstock valves. Tubing is made at the dam site and is assembled by workmen. In part 4, penstock pipe sections are trucked from factory to the dam site and lowered into position by cable. Concrete is poured into coffer dams. President Roosevelt speaks at the dedication ceremonies. Shows flashes of spillways, transmission towers, and power lines, and an aerial view of Boulder Dam and Lake Meade.\n\nBoulder Dam, 1937\n\nTranscript (PDF): http://www.archives.gov/social-media/transcripts/transcript-boulder-dam-11722.pdf\n\nCREATED BY\nDepartment of the Interior.

      "transcript": "[Applause]\n[Music]\nfor Untold centuries the turbid Waters\nof the River battered their way through\nthe forbidding Canyons of its 1700m\ncourse traversing the Arid Southwest for\nthe most part little known except to the\nNative Indians and a few parties of\nintrepid\nexplorers draining a vast region of\nmountain and desert entering seven of\nthe largest western states it poured its\nwater Southward into the Gulf of\nCalifornia carrying into its Delta a\ntremendous volume of silk and\nperiodically overflowing the prosperous\ntowns and Rich agricultur districts near\nits mouth with devastating\nfloods from the time of its Discovery it\nremained a challenge to Engineers who\nsought to control it until the enactment\nin 1928 of the Boulder Canyon project\nact authorizing the construction of\nBoulder\nDam in Black Canyon where the Colorado\nRiver forms the boundary between Nevada\nand Arizona in the very heart of the\ngreat desert of the Southwest the United\nStates Department of the Interior\nthrough its Bureau of Reclamation was\ndirect directed to proceed with the\nconstruction of this mightiest of\ndams highways were pushed across the\ndesert railroad lines thrust their\nribbons of Steel through the Sage Brush\nand Cactus and transmission lines for\nconstruction power were brought hundreds\nof miles across the heat stricken\nwastelands of the southern Nevada desert\nevery section of the country was called\nupon to contribute to the Staggering\nquantity and wide diversity of materials\nrequired thousands of tons of steel\nmillions of barrels of cement Machinery\ngasoline and oil by the thousands of\ngallons tools building materials all\nthese and much more were concentrated at\nthe site of operations in an endless\ndream the engineering forces completed\ntheir surveys working under the most\nhazardous conditions and every state in\nthe Union furnished its quota of\nlaborers and artisans in what had once\nbeen an uninhabited waterless desert\nsupporting only a sparse in hospitable\ngrowth of chaperel and Cactus the\nbeautiful little town of Boulder City\nwas built within the short space of 15\nmonths to house the army of 5,000 men to\nbe\nemployed here was no construction Camp\nsuch as was known in the early days of\nthe\nWest instead Boulder City was developed\nas a Model Town Furnishing every\nfacility and convenience to its\ninhabitants four churches a modern fully\nequipped school and various Civic\norganizations met the cultural\nrequirements of the community while a\ntheater and several clubs furnished\nRecreation a thriving business section\ndeveloped along Ong the principal\nstreets while Pleasant homes surrounded\nby Gardens face the broad treelined\nresidential Avenues of this modern\nspotless\ntown the buildings housing the offices\nof the Bureau of Reclamation and the\nCivic Administration which operated\ndirectly under the federal government\nwere set in the midst of pleasant Parks\nwhich were welcome havens of rest after\nthe day's labors in a country where the\nsummer temperature often reaches 125\u00b0\nabove\nzero in the business section of the town\narcades formed a protection against the\nTropic Sun lovely flower gardens bloomed\nin marked contrast with the surrounding\ndesert lining Street after Street the\nwhite cottages of the married

approval of\nany modern housewife tons of food were\nprepared and served daily in the\nsanitary electrically equipped kitchen\na core of cooks and waiters was able to\nfeed as many as 1300 men at one setting\nof the tables menus were varied and the\nfood was of excellent quality as Boulder\nCity was about 7 mil distant from the\ndam site it was necessary to provide\ntransportation for the workmen to and\nfrom the job this was accomplished by a\nfleet of Passenger motor trucks some of\nthem carrying as many as 160 men a\n24-hour day was divided into three\nshifts of 8 hours each for all CL\nclasses of Labor the 4th of July Labor\nDay and Christmas were the only holidays\nobserved once the rapid tempo of the\nambitious construction schedule was\nestablished and underway toward the\nmarking of a record-breaking achievement\nin American engineering\nhistory it was in March 1931 that six\nCompanies Incorporated of San Francisco\nCalifornia was awarded the general\ncontract for the construction of the\nproject including Boulder Dam and its\naerate works and by early summer of the\nsame year minary construction work was\nin full swing in Black Canyon during\nthis early period of construction before\nroads had been built into the depths of\nthe gorge men and materials were forced\nto take to boats or travel the catwalks\noften swung between the sheer walls of\nthe canyon at dizzy Heights above the\nMuddy Waters of the world's most\ndangerous\nriver it was not long before roads and\nRail lines had penetrated into the very\nlowest reaches of the canyon to provide\nthese arteries of trans Transportation\nthousands of tons of Virgin Rock were\nblasted from the age-old walls of the\ngorge thus the first thunders of man's\ndetermination to conquer the Colorado\nRiver reverberated between the sheer\nCliffs of the canyon which her to for\nhad known only the hot Silence of the\ndesert and the Roar of the river's angry\nfloods the boarding of four diversion\ntunnels to carry the stream around the\ndams side during construction two on\neach side of the river 56 ft in diameter\nand averaging 4,000 ft in length\nconstant instituted the first major\nconstruction\noperation the drilling jumbos used on\nthis job were mounted on motor trucks to\nfacilitate handling and were capable of\ndriving from 24 to 30 powder holes into\nthe heading simultaneously by means of\nDrifter drills the tunnels were\nexcavated through the rock\nsimultaneously from four headings one at\neither end and two boring in opposite\ndirections from a river level auxiliary\nTunnel located about Midway on the main\nboard a Pioneer drift was drilled at Top\nLine and closely followed by the\nexcavation for the complete 56t boore\nthousands of tons of drilled steel were\nused in this work and the sharpening\nshops were kept working at top speed\nnight and day to maintain a steady\nsupply after the powder holes had been\ndrilled and The Rock blasted power\nshovels and trucks moved into the\ntunnels for the purpose of removing the\nshattered\nmaterial an unbroken parade of heavy\nduty trucks each handling from 8 to 10\ntons of rock labored up over the Steep\nroads cut into the canyon walls to\ndispose of the material in the gules\nadjacent to the dam site this phase of\nthe task which entailed the excavation\nand the handling of over 1 and A2\nmillion cubic yards of material was\ncompleted within a period of 13 months\nand was considered the most grueling\nportion of the work for both men and\nMachinery after the tunnels had been\nexcavated they were lined with concrete\n3 ft in thickness due to the\nunprecedented size of the Boors special\nequipment was designed to facilitate\nthis task the tunnels were lined in\nsegmental sections the invert or base\nbeing the first in which the concrete\nwas placed a Gantry crane operating\nthrough the tunnel itself handled the\nconcrete throughout this\noperation the sidewalls were next lined\nbehind movable steel forms which\ntraveled through the excavated section\non Rails laid from portal to portal the\ntop Arch was placed with the use of a\nconcrete gun operated by compressed air\nto prepare the canyon walls to receive\nthe abutments of the dam and to remove\nloose and dangerous Rock from the face\nof the cliffs overhanging the site many\ntons of rock were torn away and hurled\ninto the depths of the canyon in a\nseries of spectacular blasts which\noccurred almost daily During the period\nfrom commencement of operations at the\ndam site to the time when actual\nbuilding of the dam began about 2 years\nlater to reach their positions on the\ncanyon walls the men Eng engaged in the\nwork of drilling and handling explosives\nfor these huge blasts traveled in cages\nor skips swung on cables at Heights of\nhundreds of feet over the river to the\nCasual Observer this dizzy Skyride must\nhave seemed thrilling indeed but to the\nworkmen themselves it became a matter of\ncourse and all a part of the day's\njob the first step in preparing for the\nblast was the drilling of powder holes\ninto the Rock of the canyon\nwall for this purpose the Jackhammer\ndrill operated by a single man was\ngenerally\nused the holes were then loaded with\ndynamite and the blast set off\nshattering the air with its detonation\nand shaking the very Earth with its\nForce after the blast trtic workmen\nknown in construction Camp par scalers\nswarmed over the figments of rock\nshattered and loosened by the up of the\nEXP only in this manner could the walls\nbe successfully cleared of debris\nswinging in Bon's chairs from the\nCanyon's Rim these Daredevils were\nprotected in their hazardous work by\nhard helmets safety ropes and other\nsafety\napplian preparations were made to DT the\nriver through the tunnels a small blast\nopened a breach in a temporary dke\ndelivered in check at the entrance to\none of the tubes opening the way for the\nfree passage of the water into the 50-ft\nconcrete line bore a temporary Dam of\nEarth and rock was quickly thrown across\ncross the stream deflecting the entire\nflow within 24 hours the Colorado River\nunder control for the first time in its\nhistory was flowing around and past the\ndam site through the huge diversion\ntubes an alltime record was set in\nplacing the more than 1 million cubic\nyards of material required for the\nconstruction of the two Coffer dams in\nthemselves barriers of no mean\nproportions the Earth Fields were\ncompacted to an elevation well above the\nhigh water mark to prevent the flow of\nthe River from entering the scene of\noperations during the construction of\nthe dam and power\nplant after the completion of the Coffer\ndams the site was unwatered and a fleet\nof power shovels and trucks put to work\non the excavation of the riverbed\nmaterial to provide foundations for the\nstructures this excavation was carried\nto a point 135 ft below the Old River\nlevel necessitating the handling of more\nthan 2 million yards of Rock Earth and\nsand here again the stamina of both man\nand Machinery was put to a severe test\nin transporting the waste from the very\nlowest depths of the\ngour as the cleanup of the dam site\nprogressed the ancient bed of the\nColorado River was laid bare here\ngeologists were able to read the story\nof what had happened ages ago when the\nchasm now called Black Canyon had been\ncarved out of the Primal Rock by The\nRush of water from a great Inland Sea\nand the Colorado River was settling into\nits\nbed to ensure the greatest possible\nstability for the foundation of the dam\nmeticulous care was exercised in\npreparing the rock surfaces for the\nreception of the first\nconcrete sand and gravel for the 4 and 1\nhalf million cubic yards of concrete\nrequired for the construction of the dam\nand its a pertinent Works were obtained\nfrom a detrital deposit located on the\nArizona side of the river some 12 mil\nUpstream from the dam site here the raw\nmaterial was excavated by dragline and\nhauled by train to the gravel screening\nand washing plant which was the largest\nof its kind ever built being capable of\nproducing 20,000 tons of crushed\nscreened grated and washed materials\nevery 24\nhours arriving at the plant the raw\nmaterial was dumped into Hoppers from\nwhich it was conveyed into the plant\nover endless belts here it passed\nthrough the various stages of screening\nby which it became suitable aggregate\nmaterial for the manufacturer of\nconcrete of a quality meeting the most\nrigidly uniform requirements oversized\ncobbles that is those measuring more\nthan 9 in in one dimension were first\nscreened out then crushed and returned\nto the plant for regrading along with\nraw material the screening plant itself\nconsisted of Four Towers of similar\ndesign each equipped with screening\napparatus and each separating out gravel\nof a different given size from the mass\nof raw material reaching the unit over\nthe conveyor\nbelts an endless stream of raw pit run\ngravel passed over the screens and the\nselected material carried to the stock\npiles over the conveyor belts each of\nthe four sizes being stocked separately\nready at hand when needed at the mixing\nplants a clarifier tank provided 6\nmillion gallons of clear water daily for\nwashing gravel and\nsand raw material for concrete\nmanufacturer which fell into the size\nclassified as sand was graded a second\ntime into three sizes after the very\nfine and undesirable sand had been\ndiscarded the three selected Sands were\nthen recombined into a uniform mixture\nto meet specifications for the concrete\nto be used in the dam and the\nimpertinent structures of the project\nthe sand was then stored awaiting the\nrequirements of the construction program\nas the graded materials were called for\nconveyor belts loaded the sand and\ngravel into railroad cars for\ntransportation to the concrete mixing\nplants located at the dam site several\nmiles\ndistance concrete was mixed in two\nplants one located in the bottom of the\ncanyon Upstream from the dam and the\nother on the Canyon Rim on the Nevada\nside immediately over the dam side both\nequipped with the most advanced\nmachinery for concrete\nmanufacturing upon arrival at the\nconcrete mixing plant sand and gravel of\nthe various sizes were stored in\nseparate bins a railroad system of\nsizable proportions was required to\nmaintain a steady flow of material from\nthe gravel fit to the screening plant\nand from the screening plant to the\nconcrete mixing plants bulk cement was\nunloaded from railroad cars by means of\na Pneumatic pump and conveyed into the\nbins of the blending plant where cements\nfrom several production sources and a\nvarying physical and chemical\ncharacteristics were combined into a\nuniform\nproduct this was necessary because of\nthe requirement for standardization in\nconcrete workability strength texture\ncolor and other\nproperties following the progress of\nconcrete manufacturer through it\nsuccessive stages we see the several\ningredients entering the concrete mixing\nplant where they were combined\nscientifically and under rigid\ninspection into a finished\nproduct with a maximum capacity of 24\ncubic yards of concrete every 3 and 1\nhalf minutes the high level mixing plant\nat Boulder Dam represented the ultimate\nin plant installations of its\nkind here automatic equipment not only\ncontrolled the apportionment of the\nconcrete ingredients but in addition\nmaintained a graphic record of every\nplant operation from his post on the\ncontrol deck of the mixing plant an\noperator was able to direct the entire\nmixing cycle from the initial weighing\nof the ingredients on through the\ncomplete mixing process the human\nelement was almost completely eliminated\nas the mechanical equipment was capable\nof automatically selecting measuring\nweighing and recording the proper\nmaterials in the precise amounts\nrequired for the production of a given\nmix to which the recording had\npreviously been adjusted and set here\nalso we find the production line\nconveyor belt speeding up the process by\ncarrying the component parts from the\nmeasuring and weighing Hoppers into the\nbatching bills from which the materials\nwere dumped into the four cubic yard\ncapacity rotary\nmixers water was added in controlled\namounts and the entire Mass thoroughly\nagitated as the last step in the\neconomical and efficient manufacturer of\na concrete strong enough to withstand\nthe enormous pressure to which the the\ndam would be\nsubjected from the mixing plant concrete\nwas dispatched to all sections of the\nworks and because of the widely varying\nconditions prevailing various types of\ncontainers and methods of transportation\nwere involved motor trucks and electric\ntrains were utilized as carriers and\ncontainers varied from the 8 cubic yard\ncapacity bottom dump buckets to the 4\ncubic yard capacity Transit\nmixers the latter were used on Long\nHalls where it was necessary to agitate\nthe con in transportation to prevent\nsegregation of the\nmix however the major portion of the\nconcrete handle on the project was\ncarried in the 8 cubic yard buckets and\ntransported from the mixing plants by\nelectric train a system of nine aerial\ncableways spanning the Canyon from rim\nto rim and anchored at either end to\nmovable Towers was utilized to carry the\nconcrete and other materials from the\npoints of train or truck delivery to the\ndam and other structures on the project\nit was on June 6th 19 1933 that the\nfirst bucket of concrete was placed in\nthe very lowest of the dam forms 135 ft\nbelow the level where a few months\npreviously had flowed the unchallenged\nKal\nRiver what was to become highest dam in\nthe world began to rise from the\nimpregnable Rock of its foundation as\nbucket after bucket of concrete was\ndumped into the forms the plan of the\nstructure became apparent and soon\nextended along its full 660 ft dimension\nof thickness at the base B throughout\nthe lower levels of the structure\nconcrete was placed from a Trestle\nanchored to the Nevada wall of the\ncanyon the concrete was poured in keyed\nor interlocking columns the design of\nwhich became more noticeable as the 5-ft\nlayers or lifts in which the concrete\nwas placed Rose from level to level as\nthe work of placing progressed the crews\nbecame expert in the handling of the\nequipment and record-breaking daily pors\nwere made only to be surpassed by later\nachievements\non this same\nstructure the trans mixers were\ntransported on trucks from the bed of\nwhich they could be removed and handled\non the overhead cable\nWS these were used in the placement of\nconcrete in the confined forms along the\nabutments where the eight cubic yard\nbuckets could not be\nhandled selecting at random one bucket\nfrom among the hundreds of thousands\nthat traveled From the Canyon Rim over\nthe cableways and down into the dam\nforms we see the typical operation from\nthe time the bucket is picked up by the\ncableway on the Canyon Rim swung out\ninto midair Over The Gorge hundreds of\nfeet above the forms its tremendous\nweight of 22 tons riding easily and\ngracefully over the cable as it is\nlowered into the forms with an ease and\ncertainty seemingly out of proportion to\nits great bulk and\ntonnage as the bucket descends suspended\nat the end of hundreds of feet of cable\nstrands it is received at the forms the\nsafety locks unlatched\nthe signal given and eight more cubic\nyards of concrete added to the Dam's bul\nconcrete was compacted into the forms by\nmechanical vibration the application of\nwhich ensured dense compression against\nadjacent\nsurfaces workmen were carried from the\nCanyon Rim to the dam forms by way of\nthe inclined Skidway or monkey slide as\nit was called which operated through the\nNevada abutment\nexcavation Boulder Dam laborers\nrepresented a fair cross-section of the\nAmerican working class and many stayed\non the job during the entire period of\nconstruction with an ambitious progress\nschedule to meet and with work going\nforward under all conditions at all\nseasons of the year without cessation\nrain or shine both day and night within\na year less four days 2 million of the 3\nand 1/4 million cubic yards of the Dam's\ntotal volume had been placed in the\nforms and Boulder Dam had risen to an\nimpressive height already having taken\nits place as one of the wonders of the\nWest and tourist attraction of prime\nimportance meanwhile progress had been\nmade in the erection of the structures\napp pertinent to the dam\nitself the construction of the power\nplant a U-shaped structure at the\ndownstream tow of the dam had been in\nprogress for some months and as its\nsubstructures assumed form it gave some\nhint of the beauty it was later to\npossess the intake Towers two on each\nside of the canyon wall immediately\nUpstream from the dam were in course of\nconstruction and from a maze of\nreinforcing steel rapidly Rising toward\nthe uppermost rim of the canyon these\nstructures were later to serve as giant\nInlet valves for the outlet conduits and\npower pen stock systems and the placing\nof the seats for the mammoth cylinder\nGates was an important phase in their\nconstruction located at the ultimate\nHigh Water Storage level of the\nreservoir the two spillways designed to\nact as overflow controls in the open\nbypass system\nwere located one on each side of the\nriver Upstream from the dam and within\nthe reservoir area work on their\nconstruction progressed simultaneously\nwith that of the dam\nitself one of the most interesting and\nspectacular phases of the work was the\nfabrication and installation of the huge\nsteel pen stock pipes forming the\nconduits for the power and pressure\nOutlet\nsystems this work was performed by the\nBabcock and Willcox Company of New York\nCity who ere a modern steel fabrication\nmill near the dam site to facilitate the\nundertaking as the pipe units to be\nfabricated were of unprecedented size\nand weight it was necessary to design\nbuild and install special Machinery\nsolely for this\ntest Provisions were made to manufacture\npipe ranging in diameter from 8 and 1/2\nto 30 ft from steel plate varying in\nthickness from 5/8 of an in to 2 and 3/4\nin as it was impossible to shift units\nof this size across country by rail\nsteel plate was brought from Eastern\nrolling Mills and the entire process of\nmanufacturing including rolling and\nassembling was initiated and completed\nat the Boulder Dam\nplant first step in the fabrication\nprocess after the plates had been laid\nout to Dimension was the shaping of the\nedges to ensure the Precision and\naccuracy of later steps in their\nmanufacturing this work was done on a\nplaning machine capable of handling a\nstrip of Steel\n50 ft in length the plates were then\ngiven an initial bend on a giant press\noperating at a pressure of 3,000\ntons this initial bending was necessary\nto avoid damaging the rolls when the\nplates in the next step of fabrication\nwere rolled into circular\nform the plates entering into the\nmanufacturer of the 30ft diameter pen\nstock pipe were fabricated through the\ninitial steps of manufacturer in 11t\nwidths these plates were 2 and 3/4 in in\nthickness and were rolled into circular\nform by being passed through 40-in\nvertical rolls until the desired degree\nof curvature had been\nobtained one such plate represented a\nsegment equal to 1/3 of the complete\ncircumference of a finished\npipe having been rolled to the correct\ndegree of curvature the three curved\nplates were joined to form a single ring\n30 ft in diameter and 11 ft long two\nsuch Rings were then joined end to end\nto form a shop unit 22 2 ft\nlong all joints were made by Electric\nwelding and ining the longitudinal\njoints an automatic welding machine\ntraveling on a chassis supported in line\nover the joint was\nused as these pipe units were of a size\nnever before assembled it became\nnecessary to design and build Special\nMachinery to accomplish many phases of\nthe work this was especially true in the\nfabrication of mitered rings to be later\nassembled into band sections the general\nusage of electric cutting and Welding\nwas applied not only to pipe sections\nbut to the manufacturer of other\nfabricated units as well a complete shop\nunit weighed from 150 to 184 tons\ndepending upon its design determined by\nits ultimate use upon installation in\nthe power pen stock system\ncircumferential joints were made by\nrotating the Rings making up a shop unit\nbeneath an electric welding machine\nsuspended above the line of the joint to\nbe welded every foot of welded joint was\nsubjected to a searching examination by\nX-ray and recorded on photographic film\nwhich exposed even the slightest\nimperfections in the continuity of the\nwell samples of typically welded joints\nwere subjected to severely rigid\nlaboratory tests calculated to produce a\ncondition of strain far in excess of\nthat to be borne by The Joint under\nactual\nusage the discovery of even the\nslightest imperfection was sufficient\ncause for the rejection of a complete\nunit in marked contrast with the\nmeticulous care and Precision exercised\nthroughout every phase of their\nmanufacturer was the actual size and\nweight of the pipe units\nthemselves heavy duty rigging of special\ndesign was required to handle the\nsections through the shop and high\ncapacity cranes were required to move\nthem step by step through the\nprogressive phases of their\nmanufacturing to equalize the terrific\ninternal strains introduced into the\nplates by bending and the additional\ntemperature strains incurred during\nwelding individual pipe sections were\nsubjected to a temperature of, 1400\u00b0 F\nin a gigantic analing\nfurnace this temperature was induced not\nby the application of flame itself but\nthrough the circulation of superheated\ngas shop processes were carried only as\nfar as the production of the unit\nsection as these sections were to be\njoined to form a continuous pen stock\nprovision was made to accurately\naccomplish this Junction in the\ntunnels to guarantee a satisfactorily\ntight field joint the ends of the\nsection were machined on a mammoth\nvertical Lae operating across the 30t\ndiameter of the\npipe after a final inspection the pipe\nsection was ready for\ninstallation a modern streamlined train\npassing through one of the huge tubes\naffords an interesting gauge for the\ncomparative size of the\nunit the job of transporting the pipe\nsections from the plant to the dam site\nwas in itself a tremendous undertaking\nand to accomplish this work a special\nRoad trailer capable of carrying 200\ntons was designed and built Caterpillar\ntractors furnished the Motive Power as\nthe trailer itself was not equipped with\nthe means of\nlocomotion during handling the\nconfirmation of the pipe section was\nmaintained by rigid internal bracing the\nmovement of the heavy trucks was\ncontrolled by air brakes and power\nsteering apparatus with which the\ntrailer itself was\nequipped upon arrival at the Canyon Rim\ndirectly over the dam site the unit was\nmaneuvered into position for lowering\ninto the canyon to perform this task and\nto handle other heavy equipment a\npermanent 200 ton capacity cable W had\nbeen swung Over The Gorge it six 3 and\n1/2 in track cables securely anchored\nwall the cable way was manipulated from\na control tower overhanging the Canyon\nfrom which the operator commanded a full\nview of all its movements the heavy\nhoisting Machinery controlled by\nsynchronized Motors was the largest and\nmost powerful of its kind ever built as\nwere also the track cables themselves\nwhich span the the canyon a distance of\n1256 ft at an elevation of 700 ft above\nthe River from the head Tower located on\nthe Nevada side cables traveled the\ncarriage to which the hoisting and\ntraveling cables were placed a specially\ndesigned heavy duty rig which became\nknown to the workmen as the moon beam\nbecause of its peculiar shape and from\nwhich the pipe sections were suspended\nwas used in lowering the huge tubes into\nthe low levels of the canyon while\ncradled in a sling of heavy steel cabl\nafter all lashings were secure the pipe\nsection was lifted from the trailer to\nbegin its slow and carefully controlled\nmovement over the cableway riding from\nthe rim out into space suspended 700 ft\nabove its ultimate position when the\ncable Carriage with its tremendous\nweight of Steel had been maneuvered into\nlocation over the intended Landing far\nbelow the hoisting cables were slowly\nplayed out and the pipe lowered under\nabsolute control into the canyon here a\nsecond specially designed car waited at\nthe portal of the access tunnel to\nrelieve the cable away of its burden and\ncarry the pipe section underground to\nbecome a part of the extensive conduit\nsystem penetrating The Cliffs on both\nsides of the\ncanyon with the workmen laboring in the\ntunnels far underground the gargantuan\ntask of placing the pen stock pipes in\nposition to form continuous conduits\nbetween the intake towers and the\nPowerHouse and Outlet Works was\naccomplished the separate units were\nhoisted into location with the aid of\ncables and once placed in position were\njoined with pressure pins to form a\ncontinuous\npipe while work on the app pertinent\nfeatures of the Boulder Canyon project\nwas in progress an uninterrupted stream\nof concrete had been pouring into the\nforms of the dam from both mixing plants\nprogress was curtailed only by the\nlimitations of Sound Engineering and\npractice day by day week after week the\ntop workings of the structure approached\nits full height of 700 13 ft far above\nthe crest of any other Dam yet built by\nman or likely to be built for years to\ncome schedules established at the outset\nof the work were left far behind as the\nconcrete of the dam narrowed toward its\nCrest and the structure widened between\nits abutments approaching the very top\nrims of the canyon\nwall in June\n1935 the dam structure itself stood\ncompleted two and one half years in\nadvance of the time originally\ndesignated in September of the same year\npresident Frankton Delano Roosevelt\nvoicing High Praise for both designers\nand Builders dedicated Boulder Dam to\nthe progress of the nation as final\nconstruction work was completed the\nimpressive beauty of the structure\nbecame apparent the roadway traversing\nits 1300t Crest forms a magnificent Link\nin a transcontinental\nHighway the reservoir filling behind the\ndam was named Blake me in memory of Dr\nElwood me late Commissioner of\nreclamation whose life work culminated\nin the building of Boulder Dam the\nlargest artificial body of water in the\nworld it extends Upstream 115 mi into\nthe lower reaches of the Grand Canyon\nwith the shoreline of 550 M opening upon\nVistas ungs by man until invaded by the\ngradually Rising Waters of the\nreservoir equipped with cylindrical\nGates which function as giant valves the\nfour intake Towers serve as inlets to\nthe four steel pen stocks supplying\nwater to the turbines and Outlet Val\nperched on shelves HED into the canyon\nwalls they Tower 43 ft ft to an\nelevation above the crest of the dam and\nthe rim of the canyon with a combined\ncapacity of 400,000 cubic feet of water\nper second the two spillways located one\non each side of the canyon Upstream from\nthe dam will serve as high Lev controls\nonce the water of the reservoir has\nrisen to its maximum storage\nelevation each Spillway is equipped with\nfour 100t drum Gates acting through a\nvertical dimension of 16 ft water\nflowing over the lowered Gates into the\nspillway Basin plunges 600 ft down to\nthe tunnels to reenter the river\nDownstream from the\ndam the Boulder Dam power plant is built\nin two Wings one along each side of the\ncanyon wall at the downstream tow of the\ndam the first generator was placed in\noperation on September 11th\n1936 equipped with 17 generating units\nwith capacities ranging from 40,000 to\n82,500 KT amp this the world's largest\npower plant is capable of generating 1,\n835,000 horsepower of electrical energy\nwhen operating at its rated\ncapacity the transmission lines carrying\nbed Dam power radiate in a network from\nthe dam with the major lines serving the\nLos Angeles metropolitan\narea from the takeoff structure located\non the roof of the PowerHouse the lines\nare taken up over the rim of the canyon\ninto the switchyard above where the most\nhighly specialized and modern\ndevelopments in the power transmission\nfield field are to be found from the\nswitchyard the liines travel out across\nthe desert bringing light to the homes\nand cities and power to the factories of\nthe Great\nSouthwest from Parker Dam 150 Mi to the\nSouth the Colorado River Aqueduct\nsupplies the city of Los Angeles with a\ndomestic and Industrial water\nsupply while from the Imperial Dam 300 M\nto the South the All-American Canal\ndiverts water from the Colorado River\ninto the rich agricultural District of\nthe Imperial\nValley and so Boulder Dam stands today a\nmodern Colossus shouldering the rock\nribbed walls of Black Canyon stemming\nand controlling the floods and bending\nthe will of a hitherto ungovernable\nstream the Colorado River to perform the\nfruitful tasks of a civilization rapidly\ninvading the limits of its Last Frontier\noh"
