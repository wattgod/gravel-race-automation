      "transcript": "[Music]\nhi I'm mr. Mike and this is my bike and\nthis is a quick video about what I'm\ndoing and why I'm doing it a little bit\nabout Who I am I'm a 53 year old math\nand science teacher from Randolph County\nNorth Carolina and I am going to be\nriding this bike across the United\nStates this summer from Astoria Oregon\nto Yorktown Virginia a little over 4,200\nmiles on the Trans Am bike trail it is a\nroute by the American Cycling\nAssociation that a lot of people use so\nhopefully I'll meet some new friends\nalong the way and the reason I'm doing\nthis is well just to show that I can to\nmyself mainly and I'm using it as a way\nto raise money for computers for my\nstudents I think computers and\nTechnology and school are super duper\nimportant and I think that with that\ntechnology we can do a lot more to\nindividualize the learning for each\nstudent it can make it a little more\nengaging a little more challenging for\nthe ones that need it a little more\nreading mediation for those that need\nthat that's a little bit about me and a\nlittle bit about my bike\nof course you can follow this wonderful\nadventure at mr. Michael and a bike comm\nor I'll post videos like this blog posts\npictures tons and tons of pictures\nand anything else I find and think of\nalong the way a lot of time to think on\nthe bike when you're by yourself I'll\nshow you what's in the bags\na little bit about how I plan to survive\nand the overall goal coming up next\nall right so a little bit about the bike\nI have three main goals for this for\nthis trip number one want to finish\nnumber two I want to be able to raise\nenough money of course to get a class\nset of Chromebooks and number three I\nwant to have fun doing it so in order to\naccomplish all those goals there are\nseveral things to have to happen number\none in order to make it I have to do\nthings that keep me safe have two\nheadlights this is the weakest of the\ntwo the other ones charging right now\nbut works perfect at night this is the\none I've used to ride at night I can see\njust fine it lasts several hours the\nother one has an 1,100 lumen which way\nbrighter the front wheel has a Dino\nbuilt in that as it turns it charges the\nbattery here and that can in turn be\nused to charge other devices at the same\ntime or just I have a battery fully\ncharged when I get to the end of the\nride at the end of the day up here I\nhave a mount for my phone I have water\nbottle that I'll have just nutrients in\nit\nelectrolytes things like that place to\nput extra snacks just a snack\nand here I have paper cue sheets just in\ncase everything else that's working plus\nI'll have any emergency stuff up here\nthat I need reflective tape everywhere\nthat I can possibly think to put it\nwithout just wrapping the bike solar\ncharger for the nicer days which will\ncharge devices either of all I ride or\nat campsite\nrear lights have a third light that I\nplan to try to melt somewhere but right\nnow\nthese are the two that I used mainly one\nflash in and one that can be seen from\npretty much outer space I don't know how\nbright it looks on them video but I have\nspots in my eyes just from turning it on\nsteel so no guys bright and he's USB\nrechargeable so I can make it flash or\nanything and I can recharge it each day\nI have two veneers in the back to large\nveneers the signatures all over them our\nstudents and teachers mostly students\nthat I've had throughout the years\nteachers I've worked with pretty cool\nfolks actually we've given away\nscholarships in the past my wife and I\nand now that I'm in middle school\nscholarships aren't really what they're\nworried about yet so we're raising money\nfor a class set of computers tentpoles\nunderneath I'm hard to see but they're\ntint tint cover sleeping bag\nI haven't really decided which side to\nput white on yet but one of the larger\npremieres would be full of clothing\njerseys a couple of my favorites friend\nof mine out of Texas is helped me out\nwith the bike building super strong\nwheels never had a problem out of these\nwheels still frame the reason I ride a\nsteel frame this bike looking at it\nright now this bike has according to\nstraw but a little over 20,000 miles on\nit in six years I love this bike it fits\nperfect I just can't say enough about it\nI've not I've not had any problems with\nit I've got it just like I want it just\ngot it back in the shop with new new\ngears new chains new brakes new cables I\nmean she is ready to go so am i all\nright\nhere I have a sleeping pad I have it\nkind of used it yet but it's wider than\nthe one I used last year because let's\nface it I'm a big guy\nI've lost 80 pounds to do this ride but\nstill still feel bigger than most folks\nand a tool bag with clean spare tubes\nall the tools and needs and cartridges\nhave a pump emergency spoke kit broke a\nlot of spokes as an early rider but like\nI said these these new wheels are super\nstrong shouldn't have a problem suntan\nlotion\nwell not suntan lotion but sunscreen\nthis guy here he's a new addition super\nlightweight sit at the end of the day\nsome of these guys on this ride are\ngoing to be riding 24 hours a day I wish\nthem the best but I want to enjoy this\ntrip so I'm looking at maybe 12 max the\nend of the day sitting on the ground\nas fun as it sounds I've been using this\nchair for a week or two now and I love\nit weighs maybe a pound helmet extra\nstrappy cords in case I need them\nanother solar rechargeable USB battery\nheadlamp plenty of cables and clubs for\neverything almost everything I have yet\npretty much everything a half takes the\nsame kind of cables so just a couple\nextras in case this guy here uses\ndouble-a batteries last resort for\ncharging stuff always have a backup\nfirst-aid kit got to have that basically\na hygiene bag wipes salt tablets spork\nyou never know when you're gonna find an\nice cream shop some earbuds are earplugs\nfor loud campsites toothbrush toothpaste\nif you know what that is you know why\nit's there if you don't know why it's\nthere I'm gonna I'm gonna go into detail\non that one still weird alright headlamp\nof course it's not everything but it's\n90 percent of the gear I'm going to take\na warm-up jacket for the cold cold days\na little bit of warm weather gear for\nthe super cold days gloves long riding\npants long sleeve jerseys that kind of\nthing some waterproof bags for putting\neverything in make sure it stays nice\nand dry a small stove for heating water\nand things like that now I have some\nsteel pictures of the campsites and\nthings like that from previous rods I\ncan throw in there kind of show what's\ngoing on and once again pretty much\ncovers it I'm not really big on details\nso if you have any questions about\nanything I'll be glad to answer I'm\ngetting bored of myself now talking so\nyou probably are too thank you and\nfollow me on my corner by comm mr. Mike\ngonna bike calm\nhi my name is Michael Hatfield I teach\nin rural North Carolina our school is in\na low-income section of the county and\neven though we try to do the best we can\nwith what we have sometimes it's just\nnot quite enough so I'm riding my\nbicycle across the United States to help\nraise money for a classroom set of\nChromebooks that I can use to help my\nstudents and tailor lessons to better\nsuit each student I have to carry all my\ngear be camping overnight and everything\nthat I have are in the bags in the back\nand the students have all signed the\nbags they're all following me online and\nyou can help and support by going to\npledge it org slash mr. Michael and a\nbike thank you\ngood morning my name is Mike Hatfield\nand I'm a middle school math and science\nteacher in rural North Carolina and this\nsummer I am riding my bike with all my\ngear from Astoria Oregon the starting\npoint of the Trans Am trail all the way\nacross the United States doing this for\na couple reasons but I'm using it as a\nfundraiser to buy computers for my\nclassroom like I said I teach in a rural\narea of North Carolina and we just don't\nhave the resources for every student to\nhave one-on-one with technology and as a\nscience and math teacher I feel like\nbeing able to diversify the lessons\nbased on the student needs is critical\nespecially at a middle school level\nwhere some students feel left behind and\nsome can be challenged a lot more with\ncomputer technology I feel like that is\nan easy way to differentiate the lessons\nand allow students to grow regardless of\nwhere they start at so a little bit\nabout the bike clothes tent sleeping bag\nfood things like that they're all on the\nbags I've had the bags signed by all my\nstudents and teachers that I've worked\nwith through the years had a spot\ntracker that you can track us with that\nrelays position to satellite and\nhopefully keeps us from getting lost and\nI say us because even though I'm riding\nby myself there are other people that\nthat ride this route constantly and I\nhope to meet some of those people and\nlearn some things along the way and I\nwill blog as I go through this journey\nlooks like we're going to have nice\nweather for starting tomorrow so I will\nsee you then thank you\nfirst day a few miles out from town\nweather's nice\nin a quarter mile turn right chilly but\nit looks like it's gonna be sunny today\nso I could deal with the cold weather\nstart after that I hope it stays dry\nI'll check in everything a little bit\ntry to show this much scenery as I can\nbut I tend to start just riding and just\nforget about stopping and pictures and\nstuff but I'll try to do that is that go\nsort of like first day of school you\nknow everything so exciting all the\nemotions you ready to get started\neverybody's psyched up ready to go\nlook that's gonna be a good start\nall right so here's the best shot I\ncould get so far of the actual Pacific\nOcean so close as I get to the water and\nheaded towards the Atlantic\nso right along the Oregon coast the\nweather is beautiful about 20-25 miles\nin from the start right along the coast\nfor a ways before we turn inward towards\nthe east but I have pictures just don't\ndo it justice it's hard to describe how\nawesome it is in Oregon people are super\nfriendly weather today is perfect so\nheaded that way\nokay first day is in the books\n85 ish miles not countin going out route\nto get food water stuff like that find a\ngood campsite all the gear is unpacked\ntent set up camped right by the ocean\ncan't see it from where I'm staying it\nbut certainly here and today was a good\nday\nthe weather was perfect looking at about\nlike I said about 85 miles so I'm at\nCape Lookout State Park today is free\ncamping day in Oregon so looked out\nhoping for another good day tomorrow\nhere's a shot of some of my gear you\nfigure out how to turn the camera around\nwithout blocking the view so basically\ncharges and electronics with solar power\nbut in some of the closed air out get\nrid of some stuff after today that was a\nlot of weight to carry around looking\nforward to tomorrow and day after that\nand having a good ride get more in 630\nstill in Oregon day to fixing the head\nout for the day so far the weather looks\nnice but it's starting to cloud up to\nthe west so I want to try to get in as\nmany miles as I can today\nno real goal but farther I can get today\nthe lesson\ndo overall so looks like it's gonna be a\nnice day\nI had to pull over to shoot this video\nthere's no way I would have held the\nphone who tried to ride traffic's been\nlike this for about the last five miles\nlot are beans a lot of people I don't\nknow where they're going but they seem\nto be in a hurry I'm just glad that you\nknow Oregon has wide shoulders but it's\nstill is still pretty scary\nthere's no way I could ride on a road\nlike this at home because our shoulders\nare just non-existent\nbut I think just a little ways up the\nroad we get back off of this highway\nback onto some back roads okay 85 miles\ninto day two the weather actually held\nout\nlooks like cloudy over that way but\nfound this little bike path that goes\nright along the highway here man if it\nwas like this all the way to Virginia\nthat'd be nice no traffic under here\nnice and smooth rough day today a lot of\nclimbing going through the mountains on\nthe coast headed inland now headed east\nstarted off day three leave in Monmouth\nOregon headed for the Kinsey bridge\ngonna be a stretch today but the way\nthey're supposed to be really nice and\nI'd like to have a full day to try to\nget up the Kinsey pass or take the\nalternate route if it's still close to\nstart now early still stealing me a long\nday but not as much climbing as the last\ntwo days should be a good day\na little over 100 miles today made it to\nthe base of the first really big plum\nthis is a state park campsite staying\nout pretty nice actually so I'm hoping\ntomorrow to make it over the big pass\nand down into sisters and keep going\nfrom there\ngood morning starting out date for today\nis June 5th here's my birthday today is\nbeautiful outside I got a late start\nbecause it's hard to get out of that\ncampsite this morning it was so cold but\nit's warmed up a little bit now sun's\nout I don't see any clouds but today's\ngonna be a tough day yesterday was 110\nmiles to get to this point because in\njust a little bit of us are climbing the\nfirst big cloud over hopefully over\nMackenzie path if it's not still closed\nif it is then we have to go around or I\nhave to go around\nand it's just just as bad to go around\nhowever Mackenzie past is nicer because\nthey block traffic car traffic up until\nthe middle of June due to snow and stuff\nlike that\ntown of sisters is about 50 miles from\nwhere it started it's about five miles\nago we're gonna get a little bit of\nsoreness out of my legs before I got\ninto a groove and did a video for today\nI know that's kind of hard to see it's a\nweird angle I'll try to do some more\nlater today but I really need to get to\nthe top of this climb as quick as I can\njust so that I have plenty of time\nplenty of daylight left to find\nsomewhere to camp tonight and a little\nbit lower elevations\nthis clam is terrible but it's so so\nscenic\ngot another thousand feet to the top and\nthen yay downhill\nI don't know if you could see it in the\nvideo but there are switchbacks I was\nthere and there before I got here like I\nsaid tough climb very scenic weather's\nnice the view almost makes it worth it\nnice there's a little bit of snow left\nup here a lot more than last time and\nit's chilly too so I'll definitely\nbundle up for the downhill I should be\nat the observatory in 3 or 4 miles and\nthen after that it's downhill and the\nsisters oh it's been a long day it's a\nhard climb for\nI believe those are the three sisters\ngood day decent birthday\ngood morning started day 5\nhe is really chilly this morning my\nphone won't work with my gloves so I'm\ngonna make this short so I can get my\nglove back home but supposed to be nice\nweather again today got to thinking\nabout my students back home they got one\nmore day and they're pretty much done\nthey'll be graduating 8th grade packing\nup this morning\nall the signatures on the bags it's\nthinking about different students and\nhow they change so the past two years\nand check my messages and had a text or\nhad a Facebook message from student who\nscored really really well on the\nintegrate test way way above the\npredicted score and I think that really\ncomes down to teaching them how to\npersevere and giving them work that\nchallenges each student differently one\nstudent they be able to do\nhigher level math but another student\nmay need practice on earlier concepts\nand by making sure that each student has\nthe ability to do that using the\ncomputers that we have as limited as\nthey were I think that helped a lot I\ndon't have all the scores back but he\nsaid pretty much everybody in the class\nwas very happy with their scores which\nmakes me very happy\nman I'm gonna miss those guys\nall right about 4550 miles into today's\nride I got a little over halfway where\nI'm trying to get to I ran across this\nlittle lake on the side of the road\nweather's nice so I thought it'd be a\ngood time to take a break and say hello\nit's hard to remember exactly what day\nit is I think it's Wednesday but day six\nof the know day five of the ride things\nare going good miss home a little bit I\nmiss the kids they're thinking about\ntheir graduation and everything and how\nmuch they how hard they worked this year\nand how many how far they come\nprobably try to call into the school in\na day or two to say hey but it's really\nhard to get a signal out here so\nbasically just save up video until get a\nchance to hit a Wi-Fi spot and send it\nall at one time so being as it's three\nhours difference in time I'm not sure\nthat I could catch him at school but\nanyway I am thinking about them wish\nthem all the best for the future and\nhaving a good time\nokay so just made it to about 400 miles\nthe hostel I want to stay at is just a\nfew miles up the road so I figured I'd\ndo one more update before I got there\njust in case they have Wi-Fi and\neverything I can upload it it's really\nhard to see and for the thousands of\ntime I know that Tamra just doesn't do\nthe pictures justice or the scenery\njustice though it's so gorgeous today\nbut I'm struggling this well I mean I'm\njust tired really so but I got to\nremember what I'm doing it for I really\nreally think the kids will benefit from\nthe technology I'm doing this ride as a\nfundraiser for that so far we've gotten\nenough support for about 10 percent of\nthe distance and ten percent of the\nfunds so it's working out pretty good a\nlong way to go even after finishing\nstill have more work to do after that so\nit's worth it\nthank you for all your support\nokay so getting off to a decent start on\nday six\njust climbed up I know it's hard to see\nbut for the last hour climbing through\nthat sprinkle and range up over the\nfirst good climb for the day try to make\nit to the base of the next good climb\nbecause there's three real climbs in a\nrow after Prairie City but having to\ncarry so much gear and water is a lot\nharder than I expected on these pumps\nI'm very very slow trying so hard to\nstay hydrated so I have extra of all the\nbottles I have I still have extra\nunopened bottles in the panniers to make\nsure I have plenty of water but picked\nup a stomach bug or something and having\nto make frequent stops for those that\ndon't know I have a kidney that just\ndoesn't really function due to a growth\non it that we found a year or two ago it\ndoesn't really affect much day-to-day\nbut just trying to make sure I stay\nsuper hydrated so that I don't wear out\nthe other kidney and I'm not in a good\nplace so looks like it's going to be a\ndecent day a lot of lot of work ahead\nstayed at a nice little hostel last\nnight with some other riders that are\ncrossing the country going in different\ndirections met another teacher who's on\nhis summer break but we talked about her\nstudents to talk about school\none of the owner of the hostel was\nasking about technology of why was it\nimportant you know we explained that you\ncould tailor the lessons to each student\nbased on their needs so student a may be\nbehind so he doesn't his carrot so to\nspeak needs to be where he can reach it\nstudent B may be ahead and they need to\nbe challenged and if they're not\nchallenged you get behavior problem so\nto come to keep from having behavior\nproblems if you could keep them engaged\nand on task and something they can do\nand usually if they can do it they'll do\nit it's usually if it's way too far out\nof their grasp that's when they fall\nfarther and farther behind and become\nbehavior issues and if you're not\nchallenging them and you're not making\nthem reach their full potential\nthen you're wasting your time\nthat's why I'm doing this\nall right getting a good start on day\nseven unfortunately have it go very far\nyet last hour and a half and probably\nonly got about six miles but hopefully\nfigure out why\nhey down there somewhere last night\nbeautiful beautiful country little Haley\nso three climbs like this one today I\nhope to get over by by noon and head\ndown into Baker City grab something to\neat there playing the next few hours\nmaybe try to get into Utah or Idaho\nwhatever's next right now I can't really\nremember trying to drink as much water\nas I can but still a little dehydrated\nthis morning probably drank a gallon\nyesterday after lunch at least and\nanother big bottle so far this morning\nbut not sure if Doc kidneys not\nprocessing it Ryder this\nthe nature of the situation feel okay\na lot of breath back to it fine all\nright just starting day six no day seven\nsorry just did a quick video of the area\nquick shot of the mountains\nit's 8:30 ish here so it's a close to\nnoon at home so my students have either\ngraduated or in the process of doing the\nceremony for graduation from 8th grade\nright now that's it I sent him a message\nlast night I hope they hope they get it\nthis morning but really\nreally enjoyed teaching\nI wish him all the best\ngood morning that is the Oregon Trail\nmemorial outside of Baker City this is\nday 8 Saturday Eppley is very cold and\nraining this morning not hard just hard\nenough to suck but supposed to be nicer\nthis afternoon I believe looks like it's\nclearing up way in the distance so I\nneed to get there but climbing up this\ncold rainy hill made me realize that I'm\ndoing this for a very very personal\nreason a lot of reasons but mainly for\nmy students County I teaching in North\nCarolina the school I teach at 75% of\nthe kids get either free or reduced\nlunch they don't have access to\ntechnology or a lot of times school\nsupplies are not important to them just\neveryday life is is all they know and\nthat's what take they try to achieve as\nlittle as possible because they don't\nthink they can do anything else so I'm\nnot here to show them that they can do\nstuff I've convinced some of my students\nthat they can and they have they they've\ngrown quite a bit in the last two years\nbut\nyou know I have more students coming up\nand it gets really tough when you have\nto buy pencils and paper and snacks and\nsupplies and if you want to do a project\nfor for a hundred kids just in one day\nit can cost a hundred bucks or two\nhundred bucks to get supplies for\neverybody for a big project it's really\ntough really which North Carolina cared\nmore about education because these kids\nare going to be grown up someday and and\nwhat are they going to do without a\ndecent education they're not all going\nto be rocket scientists but the more you\nknow the more options you have so this\nthis fundraiser to get computers for my\nclassroom means a lot being able to\ntailor different lessons to different\nstudents easily with with materials that\nare already presented online makes a\nhuge difference\nit's a student's on a third grade level\nreading level and you can get them to a\nfourth grade you've helped if you put\neighth grade work in front of them they\ncan't do it they won't do it it just\nfrustrates them even more and they get\nfarther behind so\nI appreciate your support this is just\nabout the last day I should be in Oregon\nmy website is mr. Mike on a bike comm\nall the information is there thank you\nfor supporting me and following me\nHey today is day 9 going a lot better\nthan yesterday\nyesterday ended up being a zero mile day\nafter getting clipped by a car and going\nto the hospital\npretty much just after making sure\neverything was okay\nlet's went back to got a motel in Baker\nCity and waited on a couple of other\nriders to join me there's a little\nlittle windy chilly but dry super super\nsuper balanced headed toward Hales\nCanyon about 10 miles from Richland 30\nmiles outside of Baker City so pretty\ngood time today little slow but\nconsidering everything it's pretty good\ncold today is 85 miles to the campground\njust across the state border should be\nout of Oregon today state to the end of\nthe road or into the Oregon I'll do\nanother quick video\nmade it excuse made it to Idaho the\nbridge down there's now crossed over\nfrom Oregon into Idaho and of course my\nhome welcomes you would climb up over\nthe dam so I guess it was a I won't say\nit was a decent Club\ngood morning it's day 11 is probably 35\n36 degrees by now it's 30 when I left\nthe hotel still in Idaho\nstill cold no clouds supposed to\nsupposed to clear up today and get a lot\nwarmer be nice it would hurry up\ngo today is a little ambitious but it's\nto range good ride today feeling pretty\ngood nasal sore shoulders still a little\nsore but I've got a hotel room last\nnight just food it was so cold and\neverything I had was damp which made it\nworse from bundling up and then sweating\non the climbs and freezing coming down I\nsaid I'm very much looking forward to it\nwarming up try to take more pictures\ntoday but it's just a lot of hills and\ntrees and taking pictures of those that\nI see anything really majestic or every\nso often stop the rest I'll just take\nsome still shots\nokay so about halfway through the day\nstopped in a little town of white bird\ngrab some lunch some water you ready to\nhead up the big climb coming up go today\nis pretty free stout and make it over\nthat clumb get down the other side and\nfind a campground be it doing good\nthey're shiny things up there are\nguardrails\nit's your hook that's the top of this\nclub cuz I feel like I've been calling\nit for hours\nit's not that steep it's just a lot of\nI'll take a couple pictures from the top\nand let you see all the way to the\nvalley at least it's nice weather\nkeyboarding day 12 I believe about 20\nmiles out from the where I stayed last\nnight at the behind that store been\nriding next to this river all morning\nhaving trouble breathing\nI hope I'm not coming down with\nsomething because of the cold rain but\nso far so good\nit's been a warmer today but still\nchilly\nhopefully it'll warm up more as the day\ngoes\nI bet that water is cold\nHey day 13 can't remember already made a\nvideo this morning or not but in camp\ndown ten miles short of the low pass at\nthe lodge space for camping got me a\nhamburger surprise good shower but this\nmorning was a struggle I don't know if\nthis is it still just so cold all my\nclothes are still damp I just can't seem\nto get warm but luckily no 12 13 miles\nup and at the talk there was a visitor's\ncenter\nfree hot cocoa free Wi-Fi donated $5\njust just just because I drank like five\ncups of cocoa but came down down low and\npassed about 10 miles outside of lowdown\ncouple contacted make more showers we're\ngonna host meet at night so I have a\nfree place today I don't know how that\nworks I don't know if I get laundry and\nfood or quiet but at least at least\ntheir house should be warm today there\nnow where you can see but behind me\nbehind me there's snow still at the tops\nof something beats lady at the large\nsaid it was unseasonally cool for this\ntime of year\nwhich I would agree but I'm gonna live\nhere set on that but like I said a few\nmiles outside be a short day probably in\n50 ish miles I need to I need to\nrecuperate a little bit rehydrate I'm\nhaving trouble staying hydrated but so\nfar so good\nthank you guys for all your support it\nmeans a lot these are life turn on the\nphone\nat a spot where I can at least get a\nshort signal and started getting pings\nhelps a lot them on the rough days like\ntoday so thanks a lot\nyou"
