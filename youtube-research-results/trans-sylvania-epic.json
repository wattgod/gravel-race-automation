here\nat the end I got my heart rate up Jordan\nkind of pushed like the majority of the\nway up over that first climb and he and\nI kind of rolled away from everybody\nelse and then\nI managed to get a little bit of a gap\non him on the downhill down into the\npavement but\nI didn't want to go that long by myself\nso I just kind of sat at like\n300 320.\nand let him work a little bit to catch\nback up to me and then we rolled across\nthe pavement together and hit that\ntwo and a half mile climb out of\nWoodward\nI tried to like keep it at 400 most of\nthe way and he hung over the first part\nso I got a little nervous\nand then there was another little half\nmile climb after that\nthat I just tried to stay in the big\nring and push up over\num and that's where I got the separation\nso that was like halfway in\nand then I kind of just tried to sit it\nlike\n300 to three\n20 just rolling\npushed up over out of Po Patty the last\nkind of really really bad technical\nclimb\nyeah and then I just rolled in a couple\nminutes I gotta keep pushing I think\ntomorrow because\none flat tire\nand there goes my lead\nand it could happen I know there's like\na pretty Rocky rough section tomorrow\nit's the same course as last year so but\nnow you know we started at nine less\nthan two and a half hours so got the\nwhole afternoon to just kick it I just\nwalked through cobweb\nhow do you deny those eyes you don't\nthat's why people say that like you run\nI'm like oh I'm Chase\nI'm chased yeah but I got to get them we\ngotta do a three mile in our uh physical\nfitness test my best time was 17 30. oh\nthat's good that's good to be able to\nride I used to be skinny Gunner's like\nnah that's respectable that's very\nrespectful like that would challenge\nLaura I bet uh 17 30 for three miles\nmy best is like 1950. really I am right\nnow it'd probably be like 40 minutes in\na hospital trip\nyou get the higher up service like the\nCardinals and that would be like let's\ndo a fun run get the whole Battalion out\nthere and then you have guys that like\nwe'd have like I mean battalions\n500.50 Marines just when it comes to the\nInfantry get these motivators to grab\nlike the big American flag or the Marine\nCorps flag and then they run up the\nwhole way down the 500 or some people\nyou like run with a flag on the outside\nand go back up God that sounds hard oh\nit's awful because some colonel was like\nthis will be fun yeah they call it fun\nruns sure sounds fun Gunner looks like\nhe's about to go on a fun run I'm about\nto go on a

not a ton of\nbigger climbs like there was today kind\nof just doing elevation throughout so\nmight be a little harder to get away\nfrom\nJordan wakeley the the big tall Viking\nman uh but we do have to drive tomorrow\nit's like an hour drive so\nI'm about to get ready for bed\ngo to sleep\nI gotta leave it like seven seven\nfifteen tomorrow heading over to Moe\nShannon State Park\nmy legs kind of
