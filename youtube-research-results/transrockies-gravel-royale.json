      "transcript": "Today I want to make a video about uh\nthe bikes that Katherine and I are going\nto be riding at the Trans Rockies Gravel\nRoyale.\nSo both Katherine and I are riding the\nSpecialized Diverge.\nOne of the things we both like about the\nSpecialized Diverge is the Future Shock,\nthe Trans Rocky's Gravel Royale. There\nare a few sections where having a little\nbit of suspension is quite nice.\nSo, the future shock is quite handy. The\nthe diverge also comes with this seat\npost that provides a little bit of\nsuspension as well. Just takes out some\nof the rough edges on some of the more\nchallenging descents. The Diverge did\ncome with\ncarbon fiber rims, but Katherine and I\nopted\na few years ago to get a second set of\nwheels,\nand we bought wheels that are\n650B rims so we can get wider tires onto\nthe frame. We're each running\n47 mil tires\nand we're running them with about\n30 PSI.\nA few years ago, we also decided that we\nwere going to upgrade our\num\ngroup set.\nSo, we went with the ShraMM red.\nWe're running a 1052\nuh\ncassette on the back.\nThat 52\nreally\ngives you just a few extra gears for\nsome of the tougher climbs on the Trans\nRockies Gravel Royale. We also decided\nthat we wanted to go with\nelectronic shifting\non the longer days. It's nice just to\nhave that\neasy feather touch shifting.\nIt's just so much more enjoyable.\nFor pedals,\nI've got\nthe\nShimano XTR.\nI've also got a Garmin\n1030 solar.\nUm, and I've got all of the\nroots loaded onto the Garmin, so we\nshouldn't have any difficulty\nnavigating the course. We are running\na one by\nthe practice.\nThis came standard on the diverge.\nAnd so that's what we will be riding at\nthe Gravel Royale,\nthe 2019\nSpecialized Diverge\nwith a few little upgrades.\nWoo!\nWoo! Woo!"
