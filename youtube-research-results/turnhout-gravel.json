      "transcript": "What's up, guys? What's up, cycling\nfanatics? This was the fastest UCI\ngravel race I've ever done, and I lined\nup with one clear goal to win.\n&gt;&gt; We got a monster gap to close right now.\nThere's one guy away somewhere up the\nroad.\n&gt;&gt; But three mistakes made it very hard to\nreach my goal. From a rookie mistake at\nthe start line to the wrong tire choice\nto a crash that ended my day.\nOh, this is Turnout Gravel, the first\nUCI Worlds qualifier of the year. And\nthe first mistake I made came\nimmediately at the start. The good thing\nwas that I was there on time before the\nwhole crowd arrived. So, I lined up\npretty much at the front row. Finally, I\ndidn't have to chase all the way from\nthe back of the start box. But when the\ngroup in front of us rolled off, I\nthought I had 2 minutes until we would\nstart. So, I stepped off the bike for\nsome reason to calibrate my power meter\nright when the gun went. I don't know\nwhy. I was waiting there for an hour\ndoing nothing. Anyway, I jumped on the\nbike, turned on the camera trying to\nstart my head unit, which was still\nstuck like very deep in the calibration\nmenu. Big rookie mistake, guys. Get\nready and be ready to go full gas at the\nstart because these starts are like a\nswift race. Luckily, I managed to get\nback on the bike very quick and at the\nfront to get a good position ready for\nthe first gravel. For me, qualifying\nitself isn't really the challenge. Just\nfinishing in the top 25% of my age\ngroup, which qualifies you for the World\nChampionship, is actually pretty easy to\naccomplish. The real goal here is\nwinning the qualifier because only the\nwinner gets a crucial advantage, a spot\nin the priority start box at the World\nChampionship. Last year, as you've seen\nin my video, I had to start all the way\nin the back, fighting through the field,\nburning all of my matches, and this\ndrastically lowered my chance to win.\nAnd that's why in this season,\neverything is about that front row\nstart. By the way, today's video is\nsponsored by Insta 360. I filmed this\nrace with the Ace Pro 2 on my invisible\nchest mount, and I also had a Go 3S in\nthe rear to capture all of the chaos.\nThe A2 has better battery life, better\naudio, and a wider angle compared to the\nolder Hro One. The difference in angle\nof view is pretty clear in a comparison\nhere with the Hro One. I'll go over my\nsetup and camera details later in this\nvideo, but if you want to check out\nInsta 360, the link is down below in the\ndescription and top comment. The race\ncourse of today was 144 km over two\nloops with only 200 m of total\nelevation, flat as a pancake. And for a\nbigger rider, flat and fast racers are\nin my favor. So that's why I was aiming\nhigh today. On paper, it looked super\nfast and it was. But what I didn't\nrealize beforehand, the many loose sandy\nsectors, they would decide everything.\nSo, 2 minutes in and we're going onto\nthe first gravel. This is a very long\nstraight line. You can see it on the map\ndisplay at the top left. Speeds are\nsuper high and until now I'm trying to\nsave energy and draft. And immediately,\nwe're overtaking riders from the earlier\ngroup. And navigating through the chaos\nbegins here. It's super crucial to keep\nan eye on the front riders of my\ncategory because it's easy to lose them\nriding through hundreds of other age\ngroupers. Now that I started at the\nfront, I can at least try to keep an eye\non these riders and not let anybody slip\naway because that's the main goal here.\nStay in the front. 45k an hour here on\nthe gravel. This gravel is still pretty\nsmooth. So, the speeds are high, but\nit's so crowded. So, it's actually\npretty difficult to get around all these\nguys because there's not a lot of room\nleft on the road.\nSo, here we are 5 minutes in the race\nand this is why it's so tricky. There's\na small gap in front of me. it opens up,\nbut it doesn't look like it because\nthere's so many scattered riders of the\n1934 age group all over the place. And I\nstay patient because I don't want to\nclose all the gaps myself. However, this\nis also very, very dangerous. Some guys\nwill be gone before you know it,\nespecially with these small barriers or\ntight turns. And if the group stretches\nout, if they are 50 riders ahead, this\ncan be a couple hundred meters before\nyou know it. And at this point, I\ncouldn't really see the other guys. I\nwasn't really happy. Here's my race\nbuddy Don in front of me with the baner\njersey, and he hammers it. He's going\naround a lot of these riders. So, I stay\nin his wheel and he's closing the gap to\nthe front. Then, that's how fast it can\ngo. I mean, I was still trucking along\nwith 45k an hour, but within the first\ncouple minutes, you could already lose\nthe front just like that. So, just to\nmake this clear, guys, I'm in the 34 39\nage group. were racing with the pink\nnumbers. All the guys in the white\nnumbers are either elite or they're in\nthe 1934 age group. So, they are a\ndifferent category.\n[Music]\nWe're constantly zigzagging and slowing\naround other riders and it's difficult\nbecause other guys are overtaking. So, I\ncan't do anything else but to overtake\nas well, or I'm just going to be left\nbehind. You can never ride your own line\nlike this. I'm constantly riding out of\nthe ideal line, next to the trail, next\nto the single track or whatever, going\nover bumps and tree roots and\neverything. It makes it super hard and\nit's never easy. It's always on the gas.\nSo, until now, I think I've got sight on\nall the other guys in my category. and\nthen left hand turn and that's when we\nhit the first bit of very loose sand. My\nbike is already breaking out all over\nthe place. Until now, I was still pretty\nhappy with my tire choice, but this this\nwas beginning of mistake number two. So,\neven though there's bits and pieces of\nbricks and tarmac, most of it was\noff-road and stuff like this, it is\nactually very, very bumpy. And like I\nsaid before, a lot of riders are on the\nright side here. I have to ride off the\nideal line and I'm just bumping and\nstomping away. You can It's hard to see\non the footage, but it was so bumpy and\nnow I'm kind of stuck. Uh nowhere to go.\nOther guys of my category are in the\nfront. So I'm just trying to find a way\nto overtake some of these guys again not\nto get left behind. It can go quick,\nguys.\nAll of a sudden, Porco is there on the\nleft on the other side of the water. How\nthe hell did he get there? That's pure\ntrack knowledge. And if you never\npre-raced this track before, you would\nnever be there. But, uh, he was\novertaking a lot of riders. And now I\nthink he is the first rider in that\ngroup. So paying attention, paying\nattention and paying attention.\nSo, here we riding through a very big\ngroup of 1934 riders and we're\napproaching the front of them. And this\nis where things get a bit messy. These\nguys are racing their own race, but they\ndon't seem to notice that we are a\ndifferent age group. One of the riders\nis even taking his hands off the bars to\nshove me aside. So, I just said, \"Dude,\nkeep your hands on the bars. What are\nyou doing? I already made up 2 minutes\non you.\" And then he starts laughing.\nWhich is actually funny because he\ndoesn't even realize we're a different\ngroup and we already caught up with them\nand we're overtaking them. Whatever.\nThis happens all the time and it's the\nworst part of these mixed categories\nracing. Guys, if you're watching this\nand you're racing in these events, don't\nlatch on to every rider flying by from\nanother category. There's usually a\nwhole line of us. Just give some space.\nFocus on your own race and battle the\nriders in your group. We are going to\ncatch up and we're going to pass. So,\nplease give some space.\nDriving the pace here again, closing in\non another huge group of 1934 riders,\nwhich means the whole slam circus is\ngoing to start over again.\nAll right, guys. Let's switch on the\nrear camera. It's the Insta Go 3S. the\nsmallest camera I have. It's only 39 g\nand it fits very well underneath the\nsaddle. I didn't use it all race because\nthe battery life is limited, but this\nsecond view perspective is really cool\nand the 4K quality out of this super\nsmall camera is actually impressive.\nBlue segment coming up. These parts are\nsuper super important and decisive for\nthis race. So staying at the front is of\nutmost importance. And I'm at the very\nfront of our category right now. Fabio\nis coming on my right. He's taking the\ninside line. And I was forced onto the\noutside. There's gates here in the\nmiddle of the road. Super dangerous. And\nthen right in front of me,\na crash.\nI was exactly stuck behind these riders.\nSo I try to go around as quickly as I\ncan get back up to speed. But at this\npoint, I couldn't tell who was ahead of\nme. I kind of missed that. So I assumed\nsome of my category avoided the crash\nand were up the road. So again, full gas\nto chase.\nRight now, I'm passing down here on my\nright. I'm yelling at him so he can jump\non my wheel, but it looks like he's\nalready on the limit and didn't have\nenough power left. You can see how tough\nthese sand parts are and why it's so\nimportant to be in the front and also\nwhy it's so important to have the\ncorrect tires. Just hammering right now.\n500 watts through the loose sand. You\ncan see other guys are on the on the\nright hand side trying to, you know, get\nthat little bit of hard line. Uh, but\nthen it's very bumpy in the grass. So,\nit's also not ideal. However, I'm trying\nto get behind one of these guys to get a\nlittle bit of draft as well. It's just\nmayhem. It's everybody for himself. It's\nalmost like you're going uphill. You\ncan't really, you know, have that much\nof an advantage by riding in a group.\nEverybody has to push high power right\nnow. approaching another corner, taking\nthe inside, overtaking like 10 riders it\nin one go, and then full gas out of the\ncorner again to accelerate. This is a\nbattle right now. It's full gas. If\nyou're in the front and manage to drop\nother riders, that's where you can get\naway from from your group. That's where\nyou make the difference. And by now, I\nhad realized my second mistake, my bike\nsetup. So, I'm racing on my Yolo G21.\nThis is the same bike that I used last\nyear. Yolio launched the new G21 Alira\nrecently and I'll be building that up\nfor my world championship.\nNice. For now though, I'm still on the\nprevious model. The main change that I\nmade for this bike in this race were the\nwheels and tires. In gravel, the tire\nsetup is everything. The casing, the\nwidth, and the pressure will decide your\ngrip, rolling resistance, and comfort.\nIn my Rule Championship video, I\nexplained why I usually run wider tires.\n45 mm with a fast knobbyby thread.\n&gt;&gt; One race on these tires, and it just\ngives me so much more grip through\ncorners. So, I actually really like\nthem. And they're still very fast\nbecause this the the knobbies are very\ntight together in the middle of the\ntire. So, but here I I kind of gambled.\nWinning is the goal, not just finishing.\nSo sometimes you have to think outside\nthe box and take some risk. I didn't\nrecall the course, so I could only trust\non others saying it was smooth and very\nfast like a racetrack. So that's why I\nwent for more narrow 38 mm semi slicks.\nEven though there was some tarmac, the\ngravel wasn't that smooth. It's actually\nless smooth than it looks. I was running\nquite low pressure, but not low enough.\nAnd that can only be accomplished with\nwider tires, which would have floated\nover the sand way easier. So, at this\npoint, I realized that choosing your\ntires to favor these key segments is way\nmore important than having faster tires\non the long stretches of tarmac. So,\nwhat tires would you ride? Let me know\nin the comments. Here we are back on the\nroad. So, I'm still a bit behind from\nthat crash and now I will try to catch\nback up. So, of course, my narrow tires\nmay be a bit faster on this couple\nminutes of tarmac and I'm closing in on\nVincent who's in my category, but I'm\nstill missing one guy, Fabio. he's up\nthe road and the longer it takes to\ncatch him back, the smaller the chance\nwill be as he will also be joining\nfaster riders of the 19 to 34 age group.\nAnd as you can see behind me, there's a\nmassive gap and this is all a result of\nboth the crash and then the the very\nhard segment with the loose sand because\nthat's where everything breaks up. So\nyou can see how fast it goes and how big\nof a gap there was behind me, which I\nsort of avoided by going full gas again\nonce I got around this crash.\nHeat.\n[Applause]\nOh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nThese loose parts are brutal. It's like\nhaving your finger in the door and it's\njust, you know, squeezing your finger.\nIt's just not just physical. It's also\nmentally you're grinding maximum effort\nin a in a sector that you don't know how\nlong it's going to last. There's no\nsmooth line. There's no options. The\nonly thing you can do is just push. You\nhope to find a hard line with less\nresistance and you just keep on going.\n&gt;&gt; Well, good luck with that.\n&gt;&gt; Well, the other option is is to crack\nand to drop and never see the front guys\nagain. At this moment, you can see my\nheart rate. It's 176. I'm still pushing.\nWe're almost an hour in the race, so\nfatigue is going to sort of accumulate.\nIt's going to get harder and harder. And\nat this point, I I couldn't really\naccelerate again. I couldn't close this\ngap fast enough. So, I'm just trying to\npush as hard as I can and not drop\nbehind. And I'm just I'm struggling. I'm\nstruggling so bad. The bike is going all\nover the place because of this loose\nsand. And by experience, I know big soft\ntires will just go so smooth. So,\nbelieve me, the biggest difference is\nthe tire pressure. And here we are on a\nvery narrow part through these trees\nhere, through these narrow barriers.\nThis time it was fine. But in the second\nlap, uh, not so much. Spoiler alert. Um,\nbut there is a big gap in front of me,\nwhich is not good. We have to close that\nup. We're 35k in this race. 1 hour in.\nWe still have a long way to go.\n&gt;&gt; Just over an hour in. 43 kilometers\ndone. We've got 100k left. Average speed\nis close to 40 km an hour. That's really\nfast for a gravel race. And I wanted to\nkeep on pushing because my goal is in\nfront of me, but not alone, not by\nmyself at the front. The way to do it is\nto find a few strong guys to work with.\nOften if a group gets too big, half of\nthem will just be drafting on the back,\ndo nothing. That's not what you want.\nAnd at this moment, uh, we're still\nriding for the second spot. I'm back\nwith Kevin and Vincent, but Fabio is\nstill ahead of us. And right now, we are\non this gravel and it looks really\nsmooth, but it's not. It's more like\nlittle chunky rocks. I guess this will\ncome close to to sort of USA style of\ngravel.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And my tires, they actually dig in a\nlittle bit and wire tires would have\nmore skimmed over these rocks. So, the\ndisplacement of all these little rocks\nis causing a lot of drag, which will\ncause a lot of energy. And another spot\nwhere wider tires would have definitely\nbe faster. So, I finally spot Fabio far\nout in the distance. Not the guy in in\nin Belgium kit here in our group far far\nin front of us. I can see his national\nchampions kit. He's not alone. He's\njoined with a few other riders, but I'm\nstill within reach and we're still\nfighting for the win.\n[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\nCome on.\nAt this moment, we're riding over this\ncanal and we're going to start the\nlongest straight stretch of this race.\nIt's just before start finish and it's\nstraight on the map so it looks easy but\nit definitely was not easy. Uh we're\nstill with with a group of 1934 guys.\nKevin is there and he hits it at the\nfront. He attacks and the other guys let\nhim go because he's from another\ncategory. But I can't let him ride off\njust like that. So on it doing my best\nto to close that gap and he notices. So\nhe he goes off the gas for a little bit\nfor me to arrive.\n&gt;&gt; Alle\nis sort of my best friend. Kevin, he\ngets it. He starts hammering it and we\nrotate. But soon, you know, I'm I'm\nsuffering suffering very very bad. Like\nI said, on the map it looks easy in a\nstraight line. In reality, it was one of\nthe tougher parts of this race. It was\nbumpy. was loose and it was a bit\ntechnical with a lot of big holes\neverywhere and you really had to pay\nattention. Anyway, with my narrow tires,\nI couldn't roll very smooth and these\ntree roots and small gutters and bumps\nwere just sort of bumping me off balance\nthe whole time and was forced to into a\nhigh power. Got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] monster gap to\nclose right now. big group right behind\nus.\nBut there's one guy away somewhere up\nthe road.\nNow look how bumpy this is. And I'm\nright on Kevin's wheel. I'm trusting his\nlines completely. If he makes a mistake,\nI'm done, too. And this was technical\nand track knowledge really mattered. For\nexample, here I didn't know to go right,\nso I was on the left, but I couldn't\nfollow. Other guys kind of boxed me in,\nsending me straight over these big\nbombs,\n&gt;&gt; hitting a very, very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] line.\nWe approached start finish, and my\nbattery was dead, so I only got these\nshort flashes of video here, but I'm\ngoing to swap my battery. People often\nask me how I manage to film the entire\nrace, which is a big challenge on these\nfour, fivehour races. And the truth is I\ndon't. I start stop the camera the whole\ntime. Basically having two brains\nworking simultaneously like one to raise\nthe race, the other one is like a movie\ndirector that thinks ahead about stuff\nthat I need to get on video. Previously\nwith my GoPro, I was al always shooting\nat a lower resolution to save battery\nlife. But now with the Ace Pro 2, I can\nget it all in 4K and get kind of the\nsame battery life out of it. So until\nnow, I had an hour and 20 minutes of\nuncut footage from only one battery. So\nthat's pretty good at 4K 30. These\nraces, they're so long. Even though the\nbattery life of the Ace Pro is a lot\nbetter, I still need to swap batteries\nmid race, which is a challenge on its\nown at 40k an hour. Luckily, two\nbatteries are usually enough. Vincent,\nKevin, and me are trying to break clear\nof these big group of younger riders.\nWithout them, it was way less chaotic.\nWe would be able to work together and\nkeep up the speed. In my head, I'm still\nchasing first position. The goal was\nclear and I'm not going to stop until I\nreach the finish line. But\nrealistically,\nnumber one is up the road somewhere with\nthe fastest 19 and 34 riders because\nthey are in the front. Pretty obvious.\nSo, we're not just chasing him. We're\nnot just chasing one guy. We're chasing\nan entire group. My buddy Dan arranged\nsome helpers to give us some new bottles\nfor the last 60k. And since it's two\nbottles at the same time, we we put them\nin the bag. But grabbing that is harder\nthan it looks, especially when you see\nthe pros do it on TV when they're going\nuphill.\nI could grab it, but I'm kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\naround with this bag and trying to get\nthese bottles out of it. And I'm falling\nback while I'm doing that. as you can\nsee here where I go from first to almost\nlast of these like 50 riders. I actually\ngot distracted. There was a banana in\nthere which I didn't expect and uh I\njust needed to get my bottle\nman. So I really messed up here. I lost\nfocus. I dropped the wheel and a big gap\nopens up right in front of me. I'm in a\nreally bad spot right now. After putting\nin that big effort to get away from this\ngroup, now I can't even hold on. And I'm\ntrying to still get some draft. Trying\nto just stay with the last few riders\nand crawl back to this group. But my\nlegs are hurting.\nSo here we are again on that very\nimportant sand section. The rear camera\nis rolling to catch the action. And\nright now power is high. Still trying to\nstay in the draft. trying to find a hard\nline, but it's difficult. I'm sitting on\n5 600 watts right now and I I can't even\nhold this wheel. You can see the\ndistance is increasing, but I'm pushing\n500 watts and there's not much more in\nmy legs. We're almost 3 hours in this\nrace. Been hammering at full gas. Uh so\nI just see myself dropping off right\nnow. Not good, guys. There is a corner\ncoming up. Usually corners can save me\nas you if you go a bit faster through a\ncorner then then you can make up some\ndistance either to get away from\nsomebody or to catch back on. I try to\nturn in but I couldn't really turn in\nand I kind of lose it hitting a lot of\nbig bumps here and then boom gap and as\nI already didn't have any legs left I\ncouldn't accelerate hard enough to to\nstay with these guys. If you are behind\nme and you notice this happening, then\ndefinitely overtake me because you will\nknow a guy that's acting like this, like\nme, is about to drop. If you can't\naccelerate anymore out of the these\ncorners, if you're losing the wheel on\non loose sectors like this, that means\nyou're on the limit. So, if you see that\nhappening in front of you, jump as\nquickly as you can, just like the guy\nhere in blue, because the gap is only\ngoing to get bigger and bigger. Now you\ncan see the difference here where we go\nthrough this corner and now the surface\nis hard. I accelerate\nand it's just easy. I close the gap\nright away to the guy in front of me. I\ncan stay in his wheel. It's not a big\nissue. But as soon as it loosens up\nagain like here again, I'm going to have\na hard time.\nGuy behind me number 815 shouts my name.\nYou know, he's encouraging me to hang\non. I'm just paddling for survival right\nnow. From chasing to win to getting\ndropped within minutes. I'm cooked. Uh,\nluckily the sand segment ends and we can\nclose up through this narrow bush drill.\nStill with the same guys from my\ncategory. So, we're going to hit these\nnarrow barriers again. And then the\nfinal mistake that ends my chances of\nwinning.\nLet's go over this in slow motion to see\nwhat happened. The rider in front of me\ncoasts through the barriers and then as\nhe starts pedaling, he clips the log\nwith his left foot and almost throws him\noff his bike. Then the log rolls\nstraight under my front wheel. My wheel\nexplodes instantly and I somersault over\nthe bars and my race is done.\nOh.\nThat's the end.\nof today's race. This\nthis log I'm going to take it away\nbecause more guys are going to crash.\nI uh cracked my front wheel.\n&gt;&gt; So, zero chance of finishing this race.\nSo, was this my mistake or unavoidable\nbad luck? I actually checked the\nfootage. The lock wasn't there on the\nfirst passage of this barrier. So,\nthat's very strange. I don't know how\nthis is possible, but let me know in the\ncomments what you think. Either way,\nwith a destroyed rim, I was out. This\ngentleman helped me, pointing me the\nright direction to get back, and I\nmanaged to limp the bike out of that\ntrail. 7 kilometers to the start. This\nis the shortest route. First, I have to\nget out of this trail.\nI did a really good front flip.\nGot some blood. My butt really hurts.\nKrenice do yo-yo wheels actually because\nthey held up for another 8 kilometers to\nride back to start finish on that\ncracked rim.\n&gt;&gt; At least I don't have to walk. The\nupside is I just grabbed that bag with\ntwo bottles. So, at least I have\nsomething to drink.\n&gt;&gt; So, besides not achieving my main goal\nof winning, which I will still go after\nin a few other qualifiers, what did we\nlearn in turnout gravel?\nMy first DNF in a very long time, so I'm\nnot happy. But, you know, I crashed\npretty hard and I have no broken bones.\nI can be back on the bike tomorrow. So,\ncould have been worse. One thing I did,\nI think I learned. I gave it a shot on\nmore narrow tires today. I thought it\nwould be fast, but still it was bumpy.\nThere was chunky rocks and I think wider\ntires would have been better actually.\nSo, lessons learned. Next race is Morca\n312 actually. And then the next gravel\nrace is the UCI gravel in Vulenberg. I\nneed some new wheels. Going to see you\nin that video. See you. And for some\nreason, there was a banana in that bag.\nBanana."
