      "transcript": "So a few weeks back I traveled to\nKachanaburi in Thailand for the UCI\nqualifying race task man but because it\nwas raining so much it should probably\nbe called mud man. There were actually\nmore than 10 river crossing with a lot\nof mud and I mean a lot. I would\nactually say this was the hardest gravel\nrace I actually participated in but also\na very very fun trip. On a side note,\nshout out to music bait for coming on to\nsupport this channel. If you're\ninterested in trying out music bait for\nyourself, you can use the links down\nbelow. And other than that, it's time\nfor Mman.\nNow 6:30. Here's the situation on my\nlungs.\nDude, from all the traveling so far, I\nhave only one advice for you and the\nadvice is to get the best travel\ninsurance. this trip that I went for\nGravton and I came back, I was so sick.\nI saw the doctor like three times. Total\ncost was like 200 plus bucks and\neverything was covered. She's sick. And\nthis is my car.\nDamn, I'm actually here so early.\nActually, I forgot you are fire. How do\nyou even bring two two boxes? That one\nis heres. She's a world tour rider with\ntwo bikes.\nWe are missing Terrence.\n&gt;&gt; Like 30 minutes late.\n&gt;&gt; It's time for the flight.\nWell, just another bus rack to take.\n&gt;&gt; All the food is upstairs. But they\nleave.\n&gt;&gt; This is way faster than they did.\n&gt;&gt; Do your own mukbang.\nDude, the the color of the chili is\n&gt;&gt; chicken rice chili.\n&gt;&gt; Just sweet chili.\n&gt;&gt; Chili.\n&gt;&gt; The green curry is not bad.\n&gt;&gt; Looks quite spicy.\n&gt;&gt; They only never see for like two three\nweeks.\nCome on.\n&gt;&gt; This is the bus. It comes with\nlights. What do you think about the bus?\n&gt;&gt; Party party.\n&gt;&gt; party party.\n&gt;&gt; Where's the disco?\nI dream of sunny days\nwhen worries vanish and head.\nI remember the roses.\nI\nI hear those mornings.\n&gt;&gt; It's actually quite cool. Very nice.\nJust\nthe corner.\n&gt;&gt; It's the room tour. You enter the door.\nYou are greeted by the walkway with a\ncupboard and a pantry. This is what the\npantry has. It has coffee, tea. But this\nis my water. The toilet is uh pretty\nsimple. You have a shower area that has\nblinds so you can technically be seen\nfrom the outside.\nThis This way they can peep at you, not\nyou peeping at them. The main area we\nhave two beds. Oh, it's pretty soft. He\nsays there's a special chair down here.\nI don't know what VJ wants to do on this\nchair, but maybe he wants to tell some\nstories. I don't know.\nIt's a pretty big balcony. Can take five\nsteps. We're lucky to have our neighbors\nwho are really nice neighbors right\nabove us.\n&gt;&gt; Neighbors time bike.\n&gt;&gt; Chef the chef says\n&gt;&gt; chef is\n&gt;&gt; we going up there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.

You can hear like everything.\nApparently, it's raining\nor it was raining.\nWe were hoping to go for a shake out,\nright? just to see\nhow the gravel is here. It's now like\n6:00 a.m. Uh, Singapore time 7\nbuffet breakfast.\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; We don't know why.
