Attack. Attack.\n&gt;&gt; Ride hard, have fun, and thank you for\nracing with us at the Uncle John's\ngravel race.\nThat is awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like\nPlease\nfollow your tax.\nBy the dawn's early light, what so\nproudly we hailed\nfor the land\nof the free\nand the home\nof The praise\nfor\nWhat do\n&gt;&gt; you got there? Some apple cider.\n&gt;&gt; Is there some alcohol in that?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. I haven't had one yet.\n[Applause]\n&gt;&gt; I'm thirsty.\n&gt;&gt; Well earned cider\nfor Mr. Third place, Matt. Excellent\njob.\n&gt;&gt; Hang on for dear life. I'm alive.\nFinished.\n&gt;&gt; That's all that matters.\n&gt;&gt; What were your place?\n&gt;&gt; Fifth. My age group.\n&gt;&gt; And then overall\n25th.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good on it. That's a lot of\npeople.\nLot of people as you can see.\nI need that license plate.\nThird place, Asad. In second place,\nCraig Carroll.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's there's some sweet bike\nmuseums in Dayton if you want to go\nthere.\nYou know, the Wright brothers started in\nbicycle before planes.\n&gt;&gt; Good day.\n3 and 1/2 hour car ride home. What a day\nthough. We did pretty well.\nUm\nthe start was pretty hectic. Uh we tried\nto get up close to the front, but they\nwanted you to line up based on your\naverage speeds. Uh hindsight, we should\nhave just lined up with the 22 plus mph.\nUm but we missed the split early on of\nthe neutral rule out. Uh the guy that\nwon on the fat bike, kudos to him. He\naccelerated. I was already at 25 miles\nan hour and I'm thinking we got 56 more\nmiles to go of this. Uh so but he made\nthat group and that was the difference\nthe rest of the race. Uh we had a really\ngood group. It kind of went to hell on\nthe way back in with the wind. But Josh\nand I were really pushing the way in and\nuh\nrocks were flying. One hit Josh in the\neye. Luckily he had his sunglasses on.\nThe other one sadly\ntook out my GoPro. I mean, hit the whole\nGoPro, broke it off the handlebar mount.\nSo, all the video is gone and there's no\nway it was going to find that thing. It\nwas at the 30 m mark or 32.5 mile mark.\nSomebody finds it, great. But, um,\nwe ordered a new GoPro on the way home,\nso that's all good. At least I took some\nfootage after that. Just a couple\nsnippets of the race, but\nwoo, second place, not too bad. 20.1\naverage. Great job to Dan and Co at\nUncle John's. Pretty cool race.\nAnd uh we'll see you next week. Thanks\nfor watching.\nHeat. Heat."

SUBSCRIBE for free WATTS \ud83d\udc49 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsr-SU_SAqjrzmu4kXIRfUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nUncle John\u2019s Dirty Ride is a gravel race across the flat, fast, dirt roads of Gratiot County, Michigan. Utilizing the Uncle John\u2019s Cider Mill grounds as the start/finish, the course traverses through the Saginaw/Gratiot Game Area, farm backroads lined with cornfields and 99% on dirt roads. This race took place on September 8th, 2023, in St. John's, MI.\n\nI raced the 56 mile route as part of the Michigan Gravel Race Series (MGRS) the \"Long\" course. I had low expectations for this race since I had raced the day before (Lord of the Springs) on my mountain bike and had a crash that left me with a bruise on my thigh and sore wrist.  So for this race my goal was to just sit in the pack and try to stay with the front group as long as possible. \n\nI felt sore in the morning, but by the time the race started I was feeling race ready. I got a bit ambitious early trying to ensure I was in any break and chased down too many attacks. This was foolish as after a surging first half hour, I eventually popped and couldn't hold onto the lead group of about 15.  I eventually settled back to a large chase group. This was exactly what I needed as the pace was pretty chill. I was able to win the group sprint at the end, good enough for 2nd place in my age group and 16th overall. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hey!
