      "transcript": "have you ever wondered if you could use\na gravel bike as a road bike we have a\nsimilarly Speck of gravel and road bike\nand in today's video we're going to find\nout\nthe road bike is a Scott addict RC SRAM\nred etap carbon mid-depth parkour Wheels\nwith 30 millimeter Hutchinson slick\ntires and the gravel bike is a Scott\naddict gravel tuned SRAM rival e-tap and\ntwo sets of mid-depth Parkour Wheels one\nwith slick road tires and one with\nMonopoly gravel tires why two sets of\nWheels well one of the biggest things\nthat sets road bikes and gravel bikes\napart is Tire clearance the amount of\nspace you have in between where the tire\ngoes in and your frame if you go too big\nyou start rubbing your frame and then\nyou're in trouble we have two sets of\nWheels here just for the sake of being\nable to switch them quickly so we can\ntest one against the other back to back\nwhen you're riding on the road a Road\ntire will be faster for two main reasons\nfirstly it has lower rolling resistance\nbecause it is slick secondly\naerodynamics it's a nice flush profile\nnot only is it narrower so it cuts\nthrough the wind but it's also flushed\nto the wheel itself so that's a nice\nsmooth transition a gravel Tire like\nthis one creates a light bulb kind of\nshape so it bulges over the top of the\nwheel it's also wider so it's a bigger\nobject moving through the air so you\nhave to put in more effort to go the\nsame speed in addition to that you also\nhave knobbles on a gravel Tire the\nlittle bumps that give you grip these\nwill compress and regain their shape\nwhich adds to Rolling resistance which\nis why they are slower that's why the\nfirst big change I would suggest you do\nif you want to use a gravel bike on the\nroad is changing to a set of road tires\nit will make a massive difference\nprincess what if you've got a road bike\nI thought this was meant to be gravel\nrise we're making a video called can you\nuse a gravel bike as a road bike and\nwe're going to play a game and the game\nis big difference or not much really\nwait no we'll work on that big\ndifference or not much difference\ngood title I like it I'm thankful that\nit means that it's not can I keep up\nwith you on a gravel bike and you want a\nroad bike because that wouldn't go very\nwell well that is the first test we're\ngonna go on a road ride now and we're\ngoing to test the key differences\nbetween a gravel bike and a road bike\nwe're going to split them into sections\nfirst section is tires you've got big\nknobblies on I've got slicks let's see\nif you can keep up with me it's downhill\nfrom here I don't get the advantage of\nthe traction do I well I guess I do well\nyou definitely don't know because\nthey're slick because you did a massive\nskid when you rode in is there a good\nskid mark yes oh look at that that's\ngangster\nforeign\nvery fast but very clearly the road\nbikes faster\nyeah because like\nthere was a bit I was peddling or even\nif I tucked in\nI was having to put a bit of beans in\nand you were literally just sitting up\nhand on the top filming like fully in\nthe wind and you and you were still just\ngliding away from me a bit so it is\ndefinitely faster\nwith road tires big difference or not\nthat much difference it is a big\ndifference but it is fine with gravel\ntires on the road you were surprisingly\nfast faster than I thought you could be\ndoing less effort\nfor the speed that you're going just by\nchanging the tires fortunately for you\nJimmy I hid some road wheels in a bush\noh it's like is it like one of those\ntreasure hunts where I now have to like\nyou put a picture up on Instagram and\nI've got to try and find them no they're\nright here okay\nsome\none boy\nwith a road cassette in the Northeast\ndoes not\nget the Jimmy Nichols approval\nwe rode up this like\nlast week or something rather\nI think I was on like\na gap there in comparison so the road we\nalso that France has hid in the bush has\na bog standard Road cassette on it so\nthe advantage of that is the spaces are\nmuch closer together so you can probably\nfind a better gear for the Cadence you\nwant to go but with a with a gravel\nchainring on the front it's just too\nhard for Road the flip side to that is\nif we had a pure gravel cassette on the\nback which for this this setup would\nprobably be a what a 10 50. that's what\nyou were just riding on the other Wheels\nyeah so the other Wheels was a 10 50.\nthe spacing for Road in my opinion is\ntoo wide yes it's fine\num but it's quite wide and you probably\nwill struggle to find the Cadence you\nwant however you are always going to\nhave a nice easy gear to get you up any\nclimb with any amount of weight any\namount of luggage and you're not going\nto get to a climb and be in this mess\nthat I'm in I think there's probably\nsomething in the middle something that's\nnot a full gravel cassette but not a\nfull Road cassette gives you that extra\ncouple of gears for the hilly stuff but\nisn't spaced out so far that you're\nstruggling to find the right gear for\nthe Cadence you want to go if you do\nhave a second set of wheels or even\nyou're just changing your cassette for\nwhen you want to flip between Road and\ngravel a SRAM Explorer cassette is\nprobably somewhere in the middle so\nyou'd have a mountain bike cassette for\ngravel an explore cassette for Road and\nnot a road cassette for Road other\nbrands are available like a grx one\nyou're ready to go\nhad a great time big difference or not\nmuch difference\nuh to where what uh\n[Music]\naerodynamics of the frame now there is\nthere is a difference but it's not\nnoticeable so\ngravel frame this has clearance for\ntires as we mentioned earlier at the\nback here and in the front fork there\nthis should be slower cutting through\nthe air than a purpose-built Aero road\nframe which this bike that we brought\nalong with us as an example of a road\nbike is you can go even more Aero than\nthat with like really flat profile tubes\nand on paper if you were to measure it\nin a wind tunnel it would be quicker\ncan you notice any of these things no to\nreally notice aerodynamic gains I think\nyou have to be in skin suit error helmet\nAero socks shoe covers Aero Wheels Aero\neverything and then you start to notice\na big difference\nthey're quite air if you were to put\nthis into numbers generally speaking\ngoing from a non-aero road frame or a\nframe similar to this gravel frame to an\nAero road frame that will save you about\nthree to seven Watts at 40K an hour\nthat's not very many watts and it will\nmake a difference don't get me wrong if\nyou were racing or doing a TT\nbut just riding around the lanes like we\nare today\nyou're not going to notice it so if\nyou're massively performance focused yes\nyou want to consider it because it is\nfaster is it noticeable and is it going\nto ruin your day if you're riding this\ninstead of that no big difference or not\nnot much difference\ngravel frames are typically slacker more\nupright position and more compact riding\nthe two bikes you definitely notice the\ndifference the road bike it rides faster\nbut then you're in a much longer\nposition does it actually make a\ndifference if you're performance focused\na bit it's arguably more enjoyable to\nride it feels faster and a bit twitchier\nwhich is kind of what you want from a\nroad bike as we've discussed in many bug\nfit videos before the majority of people\naren't able to comfortably fit a really\naggressive Road frame so in actual fact\ngravel frames like this which are\nshorter and higher suit more people as\nwell so really if you're looking to have\none bike that does everything\nthis is the one which one gravel gravel\ngravel this one\nyou we've ridden a long way away now\nJimmy should we ride back there are\ndifferences between Road cycling shoes\nand mountain bike or gravel specific\ncycling shoes namely the cleats on the\nbottom so a road shoe has a big plastic\ncleat usually three bolt holes and it\nprovides a nice stable platform for you\nto ride along with usually a stiff\ncarbon sole a gravel shoe has a much\nsmaller cleat and usually has some tread\nso you can run around in them more\neasily too is there a massive difference\nin terms of performance not huge but\ngenerally a road shoe will be lighter\nand slightly stiffer on the mountain\nbike shoe because the cleat is smaller\nyou might notice if you don't have the\nstiffest sole in the world that the shoe\nwill Flex around the actual cleat and\nthat can cause problems in terms of foot\npain but generally speaking the\ndifference will be a little bit of\nweight I would say it doesn't make too\nmuch difference at all if you're going\nto have one bike that does everything\nthere's nothing wrong with using spds or\nmountain bike cleats on the road big\nbut the ah confusing using can you use a\ngravel bike set up as a road bike for\ncommuting yeah what about a chilled ride\nremakes 100 what about an a smashy rider\nyou make definitely what about a race an\namateur race yes a pro race where it's\nlike marginal gains it's not coming into\nit no well it depends how fit you are\ndoesn't it and it depends what your\ngoals are in the race like the stage of\nthe Tour de France and the guy who's\nlike domestic might be coming 40th and\nit's a chill day you ride a gravel bike\nthey get away with it yeah 100 obviously\nobviously with road tires and stuff yeah\nyeah yeah the difference is we're\ntalking with really performance focused\nroad bikes are very small that you know\nthat's fantastic one bike two wheels\nfine sounds like two bikes one\nwheelchair all bikes have two wheels\nclearly the two adjustments that you do\nwant to make are gearing and Tire Choice\nso having a second set of wheels like is\na fantastic idea if you don't want to be\nmessing around changing them all the\ntime I think it's fantastic thank you\nfor watching please put any questions or\ncomments in the section down below and\nsubscribe for more videos like this"

      "transcript": "here's five things I wish I knew as a\nbeginner gravel cyclist number\n[Music]\none gravel is a pretty broad term and to\nbe honest we haven't got that much of it\nin the UK when I think of gravel I think\nof this but in reality it's more like\nthis gravel is a broad term it's a bit\nof an industry buzz word but really it\njust means riding Offroad if you're\nriding in the UK it's probably going to\nbe a mix of walking tracks Bridal way\nmountain bike trail and some Toe Path\nstyle like pack down gravel paths that\naren't used by cars it will help you\ntest your skills and stay interesting\nwith a new challenge around every corner\nthe skills that you learn on a gravel\nbike will help you on your road bike too\nyou'll be hopping up curves and doing\nall sorts of little things just bear in\nmind that if you sign up to an event or\njoin a local Club ride that's advertised\nas gravel it might be a bit more\ntechnical than just a smooth gravel\ntrack but that's okay get off and walk\nif you need to trust your equipment and\nenjoy yourself that's the main thing\nyeah gravel bikes are seriously capable\nyou can ride proper Trails on these now\nI didn't ride a mountain bike in the\n'90s but I know people who have and they\nwill tell you modern gravel bikes are\nmore capable than mountain bikes in the\n'90s were and they were riding some\npretty gnarly stuff still reliable light\ncomponents disc brakes Tire technology\nall of this stuff has got so much better\nin the last few years and it makes for a\ngreat experience where you really can\npush these bikes really far in terms of\nwhat terrain you can ride here's some\nclips of Tony riding the black trails at\nhamster Le the local mountain bike park\nto us now we don't all have the skill\nset of Tony but this goes to show if you\ndo have the skills what these bikes can\ndo now what Tony is riding here is\nactually a cyclecross bike and they're\nquite similar but Tire clearance is the\nthing that sets these bikes apart\nand\nI Tire Choice can make or break your\nride what you're really riding on mud\ngrass hard pack gravel rocks you need to\nwork out what the best tool for the job\nis cuz this can drastically affect how\ngood of a ride you have if you're riding\nhard packed gravel like a toe path down\nby a river or a gravel road then a slick\ntire might still be the best choice in\nterms of speed now this one is really\nskinny this is like a 25 mil but the\ngravel World Champs a couple of years\nago which I think was in Kansas your\nclassic American style gravel race was\none on 34 mil slicks so no real tread on\nthe tire at all bear in mind though the\nwider you go the more comfortable ride\nyou can have because you can lower the\npressure without risk of pinch punching\nmuddy walking style tracks that's where\nyou're going to need noobies now there's\na variety of different tires on the\nmarket that have Nobles generally the\nclose closer together they are and the\nsmaller they are the faster rolling the\ntire is going to be but the less grip\nthat they'll have the bigger and more\nspread out the Nobles are the more grip\nyou'll have but the slower rolling the\ntire will be and it's a very big\ndifference on my mountain bike I've got\ntwo sets of Wheels available one have\nCross Country tires on them which are\nquite fast rolling and still nobbly then\nI've got mud tires which don't look that\nmuch different but they're significantly\nbigger knobbles and it slows you down so\nmuch you're going to have a way better\ntime riding loose surfaces and mud if\nyou have bigger Nobles but if you go for\nskinny slick tires and then you end up\nin some mud you can really end up in\ntrouble you won't have any grip at all\nand you'll be putting the power down and\nnothing will be happening because your\nback wheel would just be slipping\nessentially the message here is Choose\nWisely and work out what surfaces you're\ngoing to be riding before you choose\nyour tires quick plug for my tire video\nwhich I'll put in the link down below\nwhich is all about Tire Choice for\noff-road bikes tra eating this\nas of today making this video most\ngravel bikes don't have any form of\nsuspension so all the compliance that\nyour bike is going to have is going to\ncome from your tires The Wider you go\nthe less pressure you can run which\nleads to a more comfortable ride if you\nrun low pressures with inner tubes then\nyou're going to be prone to pinch\npunches this is when you hit a bump of\nsome sort your tire bottoms out pinches\nyour inner tube which is inside your\ntire against the rim and usually causes\na hole or more often than not two holes\nthey're nicknamed snake bite punches\nbecause you'll get one on each side of\nthe tire as it bottoms out not a great\nsituation but tubus completely\neradicates this problem you haven't got\nan inner tube inside the tire at all\nthere is just air and sealant which is\njust gloopy stuff that should seal any\nholes that do appear this means you can\nrun really low pressures with tubis\nwithout the risk of pinch punching it's\nbeen the done thing on mountain bikes\nfor years and years there's a lot of\nparallels with gravel cycling and it\nworks so well for this too let us know\nin the comments section how have you\nguys found tubless if you have ridden it\nmy background is being a roie so we\nalways use inner tubes for training and\nsometimes tubas for racing I've had a\npretty good experience with riding\noff-road tubis but not so much on the\nroad I found that the pressure is a\nlittle bit too high and it kind of just\nspurts out everywhere and then you up\nwith like sealant all over you not great\nbut I think the technology is getting\nbetter and better and I'll be interested\nto see how much better it gets in the\nnext few years let us know in the\ncomments section tubless yes or\nno 650 BS can transform your bike ride\nthese are 650b these are 700t they\nactually look kind of the same one of\nthem is smaller 650b is actually 27 1/2\nin so that's in mountain bike sizes it's\na very very common wheel size along with\n700c probably the most common bicycle\nwheel size in the world now the huge\nbenefit to riding 650 BS is that if\nyou're on a slightly older gravel bike\nthat doesn't have as much Tire clearance\nor a cyc across bike it's a smaller\nwheel so you'll be able to squeeze in\nmore Tire because there'll be more space\nin between your frame and where your\ntire is and also where your front Mech\nmight come close to your tire a wider\nTire will also sit taller on your wheel\nas well so it kind of counteracts the\nfact that your wheel is smaller is still\nabout the same diameter when the tires\nare mounted now assuming you've got\nspace there's no reason why you can't\nrun an actual mountain bike tire that's\n27.5 in on a 650b wheel so there's loads\nof choice if you're in the market for\ntires particularly knobbly ones which\nyou might need if you're riding in muddy\nsloppy conditions perhaps choosing this\noption choosing a wheel that doesn't\nroll quite as fast and a big fat nobly\ntire won't be as quick but ask yourself\nwill it be more fun here in the\nNortheast at least everyone rides 650 BS\naround because it's fun and at the end\nof the day that's what cycling is about\nright that marks the end of today's\nvideo I hope you enjoyed a few\nintroductory tips to do with gravel and\nif you have any questions please put\nthem in the comment section down below\nif you enjoyed this video I've put all\nof my tips Style videos into a playlist\non my channel so if you go to my channel\nsubscribe and you can see the playlist\nthere there might be some more videos\nthat you'd be interested in thank you as\nalways for watching and see you guys\nsoon what was a conclusion there Tony\ncan you ride a gravel or crossbike on\nmountain bike trails the answer is yes\nif your name is Tony forcet most people\nare not called Tony foret and do not\nhave the skill level of Tony I think you\nhad fun but a lot of other people who\nwould try and replicate that might not\nhave fun yeah it wouldn't be much fun\nright I don't mind it but it's got a\npurpose hasn't it I've ridden the\ncrossbike the de because I need to get\nused to riding the crossbike but if I\nwas a normal person that would have just\nbeen horrible people"

      "transcript": "gravel bikes are a scam or are they\noften compared to hard tail mountain\nbikes and cyclocross bikes gravel bikes\nhave become quite a popular thing in\ntoday's episode we're comparing a\ntop-end hard tail mountain bike with a\ntopend racing gravel bike but what is\ngravel I don't know the answer well this\nis the problem isn't it what what is\ngravel in this day and age originally it\nwas like the little grally paths that\nwere always Dusty in nice warm countries\nbut really what it means is riding your\nbike off-road sometimes it's path some\nsometimes it's Trails sometimes it's\nmuddy sometimes it's not it's a bike\nthat's versatile that can do lots of\nstuff most of the time it's muddy here\nit's always muddy here contrary to the\nname mountain bikes aren't specifically\nfor riding Mountains they're for riding\na variety of terrain anything off-road\nis what they excel in so you've got Rock\nGardens you have small bits of gravel\nyou have big bits of gravel you have mud\nsingle track jumps pretty much anything\nthat's Offroad this bike is going to be\nfantastic for generally like this bike\nthey will have flat handlebars massive\nknobbly tire so you get extra grip when\nyou have loose surfaces and a slack\ngeometry so you're sat a little bit more\nupright than you would be on a road bike\nor a gravel bike this one we have here\nis a hard tail so it only has suspension\non the front it's got a front fork with\n100 mm of travel when I say travel I\nmean the distance in between here and\nhere that squashes down and creates\nComfort this example here is a\nCrossCountry bike which is the shorter\ntravel version of a mountain bike used\nfor racing and riding fast still so it's\npretty close to a gravel bike it's\nalmost the next logical step if you want\nto ride more aggressive terrain a gravel\nbike is a little bit different looks\nmuch more like a road bike it's\nessentially a road bike with bigger tire\nclearance nice long wheel base bottom\nbracket is going to be slightly higher\nthan the hard tail mountain bike a lot\nof gravel bikes still use Road\ncomponents but generally bigger tire\nclearance than a road bike up to 50 mm\non your standard gravel bike are these\nboth top end bikes they are aren't they\nthey're basically as light as they get\nfor the type of bike that they are let's\nfind out one gravel bike weighs\n7.86 kilos that is very light for a\ngravel bike the hard ta\nways 9.95 kilos I think it's about time\nwe went for a ride\n[Music]\nFrancis here we go hamerly Forest\nmassive network of trails and gravel\ntracks we got the mountain bike we got a\ngravel bike we're going to switch around\nand see what happens I'm I'm already out\nof breath this is different why is this\nsuch a such a hard start at hamsterley\nI've never been here and be like oh that\nwas a lovely leisurely ride I feel like\nyou're fine I'm busting along first up\nclimbing\ntest so one of the big big differences\nbetween these two bikes when the gears\nare concerned is that this one the\nmountain bike has a way smaller chain\nring cassette sizes are actually\nidentical 342 training on here and a\n5210 cassette which is perfect for when\nyou're riding very very steep hills\nwhich you would be in a marathon\nmountain bike race kind of what this\nbike is made for so why are you\ncomplaining about this little climb cuz\nit's slow cuz the tires are massive oh\nso it's the tires you're blaming yeah\nmaybe it's just you Francis we got a bit\nof a headwind as well maybe you need to\nlike do a bit more training so you can\nride at my\nstandard tires come into play here\nmassively these are 2.3 in tires the\nbike allows for this clearance unlike\nthe gravel bike that Jimmy's riding at\nthe moment which I think has a maximum\nof 44 mil tires you get way fatter ones\non here and they're much more nobbly\nwhich makes them a lot slower where this\nwill be beneficial is when we hit the\ntrails in a bit I'm going to be having\nfun hopefully bu\noh this is easier what you just spin\naround it's like a little dancing\nfeed I retract that statement when it's\nactually not going up hill so so you\njust like you know when you're go up\nhill you assume that it always hurts\nwhen you're on the flat which this\nbasically is you then notice that it's\nlike riding in sand it's like having\nbags of potatoes strapped to the wheels\naside from the position on this bike\nit's the tires that are going to make\nthe big difference difference you can\ntransform how this bike rides by putting\nmuch smaller gravel tires on here\nequally you can transform how this bike\nrides by going from Road Bike Tires to\ngravel tires the limiter however is\nframe clearance so here you've got\nmassive suspension fork with loads of\nspace in it and on the rear of this bike\nyou've got enough space to fit in like a\n2.3 in maybe more and that makes a big\nbig difference to the kind of terrain\nthat you can ride over equally you start\nputting big knobbles on the tires as\nwell they take up even more space there\nis no way you can fit a tire this size\non a gravel bike like this gravel bike\nway less space for tires this is pretty\nmuch as big as you can fit in 45 mm with\nsome knobbles on it's going to be a lot\nfaster but you won't be able to ride the\nsame terrain as on that bike so that\nreally is the limiting factor of course\nyou can go the other way and put a\nskinnier Tire on or a Slicker Tire if\nyou want this to be faster on the road\nor on like really really small tightly\npacked gravel really big difference with\nTire Choice find what works for you and\nbase it on the terrain that you're going\nto be riding do you think it's a good\nidea me riding this mountain bike\nbearing in mind I've ridden R bikes once\nwith you on one that is red doesn't red\nred means danger no Red's like the\nmiddle also you're better off riding\nthat than you are the gravel bike so you\nmight as well just go I'm going to\nassume that you're going to\ndie oh so much\nharder off the\njob not jum today well you're way faster\nthis\ntime did you get all of that yeah oh\nthat's embarrassing I wouldn't be able\nto go much faster than that on this bike\nlike it but it felt it was way slower\nthan I usually would but it didn't feel\nslower it was just like fun it was\nreally good fun based on what this is\nunder biking based on what I experienced\non this bike I can't imagine how\nhorrible it must have been on that like\nI was going to go over the handlebars a\nfew times on on the very small drop offs\nwhich I've never even noticed before cuz\nthe bike just does it all doesn't it it\ndoes so much for you when you're on a a\nbike with suspension and that slack\ngeometry so you're leaning back much\nmore whereas this wants to whoop send\nyou over you definitely do feel it in\nthe back wheel though it does like\nbecause it hasn't got full suspension I\nlike the idea of having a go on it on\nthe gravel bike but it just be too\ndangerous I'm not going to do it the\nbiggest the biggest difference I think\nis the hand position that is a much more\nstable position for your hands to be in\nyou got stronger like your grip is\nstrong on the bars you feel secure this\nyou don't because they're basically well\nthey are Road levers riding this bike on\nthese Trails for the first time you you\nfind huge bumps and huge little dips in\nthe trailer which you've never even\nnoticed before so uh yeah I mean it's\nfun but it is a very big difference I\nmean thank goodness I've got 45 mil Tire\non otherwise this would be Savage time\nfor me to ride the hard\ntail coming straight off the gravel bike\nuntil this it's such a treat it rides so\nwell the difference is night and day\nwhen you're on a trail like that and\nthis isn't in it's not a very technical\nTrail it's pretty smooth and flowy one\nvery similar thing I would mention\nthough is braking performance they I've\ngot 160 rotors on cuz this is a uh XC\nbike hard tail XC bike whereas the full\nsus I have 180 the difference is very\nmarginal between the gravel bike and\nthis in terms of braking power last\nlittle bit of Trail now I'll see if I\ncan find Jimmy wherever he's\ngone so\nCatherine what is better a hard tail\nmountain bike or a gravel\nbike definitely a gravel\nbike I hate mountain bikes but I also\nlove mountain bikes there's a gravel\nbike there's a mountain bike I'm going\nto pick the gravel bike I think what I\nwasn't expecting with mountain bikes you\ncan just ride through stuff and it just\ngoes whereas like on a gravel bike or a\nBrak that doesn't have suspension and\nand that big wide upright positioning\nyou know you notice it I think perhaps\nthe key is something in between both for\nthe record we don't actually know why\nNick is\nhere I'm just babysitting it's your baby\nI wanted to talk about compatibility\nwith your existing stuff so I think the\nreason why gravel bikes are popular is\nbecause what they look like road bikes\nso people who have been into Road\ncycling a long time look at that and\nthey go oh well my cassette is going to\nfit my current road wheels are going to\nfit so I can put those on and use it on\nthe road my handlebars and Stems are all\ngoing to fit it's all the same size my\nrotors are going to match if you got\ndisc brakes on there there's loads of\ncompatibility with all of your parts and\nall your spares and all of your tools\nwhereas that the reason our friend Nick\nwho runs a bike shop doesn't like\nworking on mountain bikes is because\nit's a whole different set of tools you\nknow you got to have different stuff\nthere to be able to service different\nthings how the hell do you even service\na a a fork thing what are they called\nyou take it you undo it with normal\nAllen keys and then you take it off and\nyou send it back so with suspension\ngenerally a bike shop would send that\nstuff back anyway but it's all it's all\nthe other stuff the different standards\nlike if a bottom bracket on one of my\nbikes breaks I know I can steal one from\nanother bike it's just convenient and I\nthink that's a valid reason to choose a\ngravel bike over a hard tail if you're\njust going to be riding some light\noff-road stuff but you already have\nloads of road bikes consider that it's\nloads of the same tools and loads of the\nsame space this a Tony foret 19 time\nNortheast cyclocross champion and came\nthird in the world third in the world\nwhat's the difference between a gravel\nbike and a cross bike basically the\nmodern gravel bike is longer and lower I\nthink it's about 15 M lower in the\nbottom bracket area and it's a lot\nlonger in whale beas so it's not as\nNimble in the corners would you race a\ngravel bike at a Cy cross race I\nwouldn't\nI would choose to race a Cy cross bike\nat a Cy cross event however I do think\nyou can race sight Lacross on a gravel\nbike told you there is a difference I\nthink if I had to choose one gravel bike\nwould be it it just is more versatile\nyou can do if you have the skills to do\nit anything you could do on a cross\ncountry bike using a gravel bike I think\nthe type of riding that I do the\nmountain bike would just not be\nappropriate you're always going to be in\na a very upright position which although\nis stable it's just Overkill and then\nit's going to slow you down the tires\nare going to be sluggish even if you put\ngravel tires on on the flat bar mountain\nbike I just don't need to be in that\nposition for the riding that I do one\ngravel bike with a wheel set that also\nhas road tires on it pretty much would\ndo everything that I ride thank you for\nwatching please let us know in the\ncomments section if you'd like to see us\ncompare something else to something else\nand what those two things would be\npreferably bikes preferably bikes not\nturning into me appreciate it see see\nyou soon"
