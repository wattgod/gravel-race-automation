times has revolved around\nThursdays when I'm in Boulder I do not\nmiss this ride what is this ride it's\njust a casual fun goofy emphasis on\nGoofy and we don't go fast we definitely\ndon't wear spandex unless it's some sort\nof fabulous leotard or something and\nit's all about fun when I think of my\ncommunity my beloved Boulder the Cruiser\nride is one of my absolute favorite\nthings that happens in this town that's\nstill a little bit weird Boulder's\ngotten a little shiny but the cruiser\nside is still holding strong with its\nweirdness\nfootage the second video\nuploaded to my YouTube channel was back\nin July 2006 and it was the Thursday\nCruiser ride and not a whole lot has\nchanged\nso here we are riding down an alley\nhaving a great time on Pearl Street\nwe're cruising
