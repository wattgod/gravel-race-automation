Hosted on the luxury High Lonesome Ranch, riders will be treated to a country cook-out, campfire, cabins, camping \u2013 or glamping \u2013 and the best local music. In short, there will be a Colorado country party to accompany the ride.\" - Roll Massif\n\n\"In addition to being hidden well, well off the beaten path, The High Lonesome Ranch and its surrounding area isn\u2019t open to riding year-round, so participants benefit from exclusive access to this secret stash of wild-west gravel. You\u2019ll only be disappointed if you were hoping for a bunch of auto traffic on the route.\"\n\nThe new for 2019 Wild Horse Gravel had two routes to choose from; an out and back 70+ miler from The High Lonesome Ranch to De Beque, Colorado, or a shorter loop that took in De Beque and headed the short way to The High Lonesome Ranch.

      "transcript": "[Music]\ngood morning from the high lonesome\nranch out here in the beautiful western\nslope of Colorado today it's the\ninaugural wild horse gravel and we're\ngoing deep in the backcountry for some\ngravelly goodness you ready let's roll\ndon't ride above your ability on the\ndescents be aware that you can cover the\ntrenches coming to you from the\nbeautiful Colorado and we're often\nrunning in the inaugural wild horse\ngravel writers had the choice of two\ncourses a longer Alton back course\nfeaturing two timed segments or a\nshorter course with one timed segment\nboth courses stop in this small western\nColorado town of de Becque wild horse\nscramble isn't a race rather a ride\nalthough there are two possible timed\nsegments I'd wager one or two riders are\ntaking the segment's seriously whilst\nmost of us are there to take in the\nscenery and a pile of photographs beyond\nthe scope of these segments the ride is\nnot timed the chest cam view is from Ben\nDelaney the gentleman who introduced the\nvideo earlier\nbarring the scenery of the high desert\nyou will likely encounter all manner of\ncritters including cows and wild horses\nI'm well into the one and only timed\nsegment for the short course and rolling\na steady tempo pacing myself from other\nwriters or using them as a carrot to\nchase residing at sea-level for much of\nthe year along with being sleep-deprived\nI wasn't expecting a world class time\nduring the segments the course descended\na little during the segment but this\nwasn't the time or place to push it hard\nconditions were loose and rutted in\nplaces requiring a careful choice of\none's line\nin this scene Ben who makes his home\nnear Boulder Colorado these days fuels\nthe effort of this steady uphill grade\nof the first time segment\nthe segment saved the best for last were\nthere very steep climb finishing\nproceedings followed by another steep\nhill to reach the neutral water station\nhere are some writers who completely\ntrashed did so nicely done\nok slackers come on keep going here keep\ngoing it's all suffering going on here a\nlot of suffering all right good job\nslackers very nice you should see what's\nat the top of this client massage tables\nnot really naturally there's nothing up\nthere\nfollowing the neutral water station I\nmade the strategic decision to ride the\nshort course I'd see just as much epic\nscenery as the long course albeit with\nsignificantly less climbing it was one\nof those days where I wasn't feeling\nsuper primo day off the ride however I\nmade sure to stop several times to\ncapture photos and video the grinder au\nformat of racing is a ton of fun and\nquite relaxing versus focusing\ncompletely on an ever running clock\nthere was much descending following the\nneutral water station between the town\nof the Beck mixed with beautiful scenery\nthis part of the course made for a super\nfun experience\nsomewhere along the first half of the\nwild horse gravel course and as you can\nsee behind me the scenery is pretty\namazing this view from Ben's chest camp\nprovides a better idea of how rough some\nareas of the course really were Ben\nmaintains a relaxed position on the\ndrops with his weight positioned towards\nthe rear of the bike here he's mixing it\nup with some tandem Oni in action the\nonly tandem team had wild horse gravel\nas I drew closer to de Becque there were\nseveral flatter open areas where you\ncould see for miles mentioned earlier\nduring the time the segments the rest of\nthe course wasn't timed but there was a\ncut-off time in the town of the Beck for\nthe long\nthe return leg of the long course was\nwritten on these road you see on camera\nalbeit in the reverse direction the\nreturn ride was not an easy undertaking\nthe weather on event day was spectacular\nat ride start it was a tad cool enough\nfor our mourners and a base layer but by\nlate morning the temperatures had warmed\nup to the low 70s Fahrenheit the perfect\nweather for riding\nin this scene on rolling downhill into\nthe bustling metropolis of the Bek\npopulation around 500 people circa 2010\nI can't how's it going out there oh it's\nso lovely out there's gonna ask for a\nbetter day rained a little bit yesterday\nit's nice and tacky little little spots\nto keep you on your toes all sorts of\nbeautiful folks out here this is the\nonly pavement off the ride and it only\nfeatured on the shore course for\napproximately three to four miles before\nreturning to the dirt and gravel roads\nof the high lonesome ranch I crossed the\nfinish line nice and early allowing for\nplenty of time to catch finishes from\nthe long course looking down from above\nin summary the inaugural wild horse\ngravel was a ton of fun with excellent\nsupport on course plenty to do at the\nstart and finish off the chart scenery\nand being a smaller event it had a great\nvibe providing a rich experience for all\nattendees definitely a ride people\nshould consider looking at in 2020 in\nthe mean time row massive have more\ngravel events on their calendar be sure\nto check them out at Ron Nassif dot-com\nthank you for watching if you haven't\nalready please subscribe to the gravel\ncyclists youtube channel and don't\nforget to click the barrel button to be\nnotified of future videos as they

      "transcript": "FAL Fondo is July 23rd this year up in\nbeautiful Fort Collins Colorado and\nthere are four distances to choose from\neverything from the 12m safe routes for\nschool family route which goes on bike\npass up to the premier distance 118 Mi\nwhich starts with a big loop out on the\nplains on the rollers and then takes you\nup into the mountains across section of\nranch that is only accessible during the\nevents up into the beautiful National\nForest today I'm out here here with the\nrace Founders race organizers Whitney\nand Zach Allison and our friend Michael\ncaner to show you all the good times and\nbeautiful scenery that you're in for\nthis July\n[Music]\n23rd fola Fondo began in\n2015 it was founded by Zach my husband\nand his friend Jake Arnold and they used\nit as a way to kind of explore some new\nroutes because it was getting kind of\nboring just doing all the same road\nriding routes all the time for road race\ntraining and at the beginning it was\nmostly a hide a cooler and a ditch sort\nof scenario and so it's pretty fun that\nit's grown into what it has now when we\nstarted folo Fondo I sort of envisioned\nlike a huge training group where like\nwe're riding places without water we're\npushing the limits of our like road\nbikes with the fattest Tire we can fit\non there so like a 28 maybe a maybe a 30\nmm tire and I feel like we're on the\nright side of the wave or like we are\nwaiting for the wave of gravel to come\nand we didn't realize how big of a wave\nwe were paddling into we have grown as\npromoters with the event growing which I\nthink is you know probably one of the\ndefinitions of Grassroots too even if\nnow we don't consider our own event\nGrassroots it's still um really fun to\nhave the event grow from you know\ncoolers in a ditch at the halfway point\nand you know mom's baking muffins and\nstuff for the Finish Line to like where\nwe're at now at the event the courses\nall kind of go out the same direction\nthey all go east out of town first um I\nfeel like folo Fondo is one of the\nlarger events from a larger mediumsized\nCity most of like these really big\ngravel events are from really small\ntowns really rural towns which make it a\nlot easier to promote that event but\nwe're really lucky with how New Belgium\nour venue is situated at kind of on the\nedge of town so we have a few miles of\npavement to get out east of I25 and each\nof the three longer routes the 3550 and\n118 all go east first they go out into\nthe Rolling Hills on a bluff that's just\neast of Fort Collins um and everything\nkind of makes its way North the 35 and\n50 come back West clear across town\nnorth of Wellington and then South back\nto Fort Collins where the 118 mile route\ncontinues very far Northwest to do this\nCherokee Park loop that we're at right\nnow yeah as someone who moved to Fort\nCollins pretty pretty recently the\nriding is is pretty exceptional to be\nable to have access to the planes out in\nthat direction but then to also have the\nmountains in the other direction uh\nwhich in my opinion are just a lot more\nfun given the landscape out here and how\nFort Collins just sits on the cusp of\nthe Foothills and the plains in\nnortheastern Colorado um you're going to\nget to experience the Best of Both\nWorlds we are on the folo Fondo long\nRoute 118 miles for 2023 this is the\nprivate property Roberts ranch sector\nthis is the turnoff onto double track um\n100% of the Year minus that one day on\nFCO Fondo day it has very large very\nscary looking cows on it so um stay off\nuntil FCO Fondo day um but huge thank\nyou to Zack thod and the Roberts ranch\nfor letting us pass on this sector under\n287 keeping everyone safe and off the\nhighway and out to the awesome Western\nLoop West and north of Fort Collins we\nare in the Red Feather Lakes area so\nit's just Northwest of Fort Collins a\nlot of the roads out here are gravel so\nthe first road that you go up on the 118\nmile route is a pretty Common Road for\nlike camping and other sort of outdoor\nactivities so it does see a bit more\ntraffic and it can have some Brak ruts\nin it but overall it's pretty fast and\nsmooth and then from there we J off on\nsome B- roads that are a little bit less\nmaintained and have a lot less traffic\nand so then you arrive at the top and\nnow you're in Switzerland here and\nyou're going to fall out of the sky on\nthis pretty epic uh not super used Road\nwhat's the tire\nchoice not the specific model\nnecessarily but yeah skinny fat knobby\nwe're pitching like a really fast trvel\ntire so like something like a 36\nvulpine designed for like hard pack\nyou're going to average you know the\nlead grp is going to average over 18 19\nM hour so it's like you don't want\nanything too bulky\nthere's nothing really big to flat on\nand you want to just roll fast and have\nsomething lighter for the climbs now\nright now this road now that I'm saying\nI'm I'm jous going to say this road was\nsmooth as butter yeah a lot of a lot of\nthese roads are so so well groom we just\npass some trucks blading the road laying\ndown mad chloride to T down the dust is\nthat typical for July also yeah it gets\na little bit chunkier and more like\ncamping and and people are active up\nhere and driving around but it really\ndoesn't get much worse than this then we\nhave to seek out the B- roads which is\nlike nice that we do that by choice\ninstead of making the whole route that\nway and then from the top there's a\nreally fun descent but it does get\nreally chunky so you do have to sort of\nmitigate your light or heavy Tire Choice\non a couple fun downhill bigger harer\ngrael SE July in Fort colge\nis often pretty warm um last year we\nactually had probably the coolest July\nfolo Fondo ever um but with that being\nsaid it's normally in the 80s I would\nsay maybe peaking above uh 90 and then\nwhat's pretty common in Colorado is you\nusually have a small afternoon\nthunderstorm that blows through it's\nmaybe like 5 or 10 minutes um that's\njust something to be aware of there's\nreally not a whole lot that you can do\nabout it so the eight stations um are\nput together each by a different\nvolunteer organization or group The\nnitty-gritty of it is kind of wild when\nyou're like okay we're going to two have\n2,000 people roll through A1 if everyone\nyou know on average wants 48 ounces of\nwater then we're going to need 380\ngallons of water so how do you bring 380\ngallons of water to a place in the\nmiddle of nowhere without a spigot um\nbut the aid stations are really well\nstocked so Aid 1 is 20 m in a lot of\npeople on the long run rout will kind of\nblow that Aid two um on the long route\nis going to be on the way out Park Creek\nby Park Creek Reservoir um so you can\nkind of refuel as you get ready to head\nup the this really long climb and then\nthe um second to last aid station aid3\non the long course is going to be at\nthis Vista uh right behind me on the\ncounty road um and then the last aid\nstation which also serves as the second\naid station in the 50 mile is on the way\nback into town and then there's the ever\npartying Oasis that is with five miles\nto go so if you're going for a buo tie\ntime be careful of how long you\ndilly-dally at the Oasis um but\nhopefully you went fast enough to be\nable to grab a beer send it off a launch\nramp um check out the BB gun uh by\nAthlon course and make it back in time\nfor a\nbuai at Fondo there's definitely a lot\nof people that are racing we do have a\n$9,000 prize per split between men women\nand non-binary Riders um beyond that we\nalso have the bolo tie times on the W 18\num Ben will provide an update on those\ntimes because we still have to figure\nthat out so we do have a lot of people\nthat go for that and that is uh a really\nlarge source of Pride for people to\ncomplete the route under the designated\ntime for that and then beyond that like\nyou know it probably is about 50% of\nriders that will do the long route that\nwill be going for completion and that's\npretty badass too I think one of my\nfavorite Parts about\nFondo is we end up being a lot of\npeople's firsts so I think a lot of that\ncomes from like the training ride series\nthat we do that's free for the community\nfrom January to July but we try to help\npeople\num kind of be able to push their limits\nand enjoy riding in this new way and\ndiscover something about themselves f\nFondo packs a lot of great location into\nthe routes themselves but there's also\nthe great location of the start finish\nand the Afterparty that's here at New\nBelgium on the northeast corner of Fort\nCollins New Belgium as you may know\nBrews Fat Tire Ranger IPA and many other\ntasty beverages you can take tours here\nyou can do tastings today John yeast is\ngiving us a tour of the Carney shop the\nSanta's Workshop of tour to Fat among\nother bike festivities tour to fat is a\ncostume bicycle parade that\nspontaneously erupts into a party that\nbenefits local bike nonprofits uh and by\nlocal bike nonprofits I'm talking about\nspecifically here in Fort Collins\nOverland mountain bike Association bike\nFort Collins uh Fort Collins Bike Co-op\nand sent toown bike club and ultimately\nthose uh four nonprofits benefit from\nbeer sales at the event and over the\ncourse of 21 plus years Trad has helped\nraise raised over $8 million in uh funds\nfor local bike nonprofits this is part\nWorkshop uh part Museum uh part art\ndisplay and then part functionality this\nis a laboratory uh this is where we get\na chance to build a lot of the stuff\nthat we go on the road with the art\nbikes or freak bikes um as they're\nsometimes called these were created as\nas uh an opportunity for people to find\nthe joy of riding a bicycle again and so\nyou get an opportunity to try new things\nso bikes are just in our DNA I mean it\nstarts with having a bicycle on the\nbottle of Fat Tire uh we were created on\na bicycle in 1991 when Jeff leish and\nKim Jordan started new Belgian Brewing\nuh they really truly believed in uh\nsustainability and and looking out for\nthe environment in the world around us\nand so uh supporting bicycle culture\nsupporting bike riding with you know\nFinancial dollars I think that's what's\nreally kind of pushed us uh to uh create\nof fat and to really support larger\norganizations that are doing what what\nwe can't I mean you know bringing beer\nto the party is is one thing but uh the\nleague of American bicyclists and people\nfor bikes and imba and the international\nmountain bike Association they're the\nones that are actually um walking the\ntalk and and so we're trying to support\nthem as best as we can um and also those\nLo local organizations Fondo is July 23\nyou can find out all the details and\nsign up to partip ipate at foco.com hope\nto see you here in Fort Collins\ncheers and like the cruiser bike says\nhere at New\nBelgium enjoy the ride"

      "transcript": "Colorado has an abundance of gravel race\nriches this year including a new series\ncalled the colorado summer of gravel\nthis new series runs mid-may through\nJuly and includes CO2 UT in the desert\nof Western Colorado the Telluride gravel\nrace in the mountainous South Ned gravel\nhigh up in central Colorado just up the\nhill from my home in Boulder and foco\nFondo to the North in Fort Collins\ncombined is quite the varied tour of\nColorado's diverse topography and gravel\nservices for instance I did focofondo\nlast year on my NV road bike with 32s\nand I did Ned gravel last year on a laof\nTrue Grit with that leaf suspension fork\nand honestly I would have been happy on\na mountain bike I have not yet done\nTelluride nor CO2 UT but I intend to\nremedy that soon\nforeign\n[Music]\nthe series concept is relatively new to\ngravel racing and unlike the big dollar\nlifetime Grand Prix and the Belgian\nwaffle ride series Each of which\nfeatures seven events operated by the\nsame owner the Colorado summer of gravel\nis a partnership between four\nindependent events\nWhitney and Zach Allison run focofondo\nand they helped spearhead the Coalition\nwith Telluride and Ned gravel and CO2 UT\nthe scene here for cycling particularly\nbike racing has changed a lot here in\nColorado in the last couple of years a\nlot of the road racing opportunities\nhave really dwindled and one of the\nhopes for Colorado summer of gravel is\nto provide an Avenue and outlet and a\nreally great series that doesn't require\nextensive travel or\ntons of money in order to participate in\nit I really hope it provides an\nopportunity for up-and-coming Racers to\ncontinue to grow in the sport and use\nthis as a way to keep repelling\nthemselves forward\njust like with the Grand Prix and the\nBelgian waffle ride series you don't\nhave to do the whole series of course\nyou can sign up for events individually\nbut by registering for all four you can\nsave a little money and qualify for the\nthree thousand dollars on tap to do the\nfour races it's 500 bucks for the\nColorado series for context Unbound\ngravel one entry is two hundred and\nninety dollars now I'm not trying to\ndissuade you from doing the big ones I\nthink there's certainly something to be\nsaid for doing one of the monuments of\ngravel whether that's Unbound or\nSteamboat or Belgian waffle ride\nCalifornia or the Mid-South but I'm also\na proponent of doing smaller races where\nyou will have a ton of fun and most\nlikely feel a lot less pressure and\nstress about the whole thing\nso let's take a quick look at the main\nevents for each of the four races which\nall offer shorter distances as well\nc-o-t-u-t in Fruita kicks it off May 14.\ndubbed desert gravel this is the\nflattest and sandiest event in the\nseries at 100 miles and 5 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race is 159 if\npurchased separately Telluride is a\nsecond year event last year former U.S\nnational champion Alex house and my\nbuddy Betsy Welch took the wins in the\nmen's and women's races respectively\nBetsy texted me halfway through the race\nhey is it uh okay to keep racing on a\nBroken Spoke\nevidently it was this race is the\nclimbiest of the lot with 85 miles\nbringing in about 10 000 feet of\nelevation gain this race costs 145\ndollars hey this is Scott benge with the\nTelluride growl race going into our\nsecond year we couldn't be more excited\nto be involved in the Colorado summer of\ngravel series what intrigued us the most\nabout the series is the smaller\nindependent races that make it up all\nacross the state not having to make\nmajor travel plans and being able to\nparticipate in a series with a prize\npurse right here in our great state of\nColorado is super special so we can't\nwait to see you all out there Ned gravel\nis only 60 miles but I'm here to tell\nyou it is a brutal 60 miles with 7100\nfeet of climbing it starts over 8 000\nfeet in Netherland and the route tackles\nSwitzerland Trail which is rough\nthis race is 110 dollars if done alone\nhey I'm Gavin Coombs the race director\nfor Ned gravel bike race uh we are so\nexcited to be part of the Colorado\nsummer of gravel\num you're just going to be showcasing\nthe best of Colorado gravel and\neverything that Colorado has to offer an\ninclusive and welcoming way that is just\ngoing to be great for everyone for the\nseries Nate gravel is offering up our\ntungsten course which is new for this\nyear at 70 miles and 8 300 feet of\nclimbing it's a challenging course made\nsome changes over the last couple of\nyears to it it's going to be bigger and\nbetter than ever\nso come on out see what Colorado has to\noffer for gravel and we'll see out there\nand then focal Fondo starts and finishes\nat New Belgium brewery just on the\noutskirts of downtown Fort Collins\nthe 118 mile event is the main one this\nyear last year I got third in the 100\nMiler while Alexi vermeulen won the 140\nmiler I doubt I will be on the podium\nthis year the 118 mile course is new for\n2023 for foco Fondo it kind of rounds\nout a mix of the 100 mile course that\nhas less climbing from the last few\nyears and the 145 that was a little bit\ntoo much to have so much fun on from\n2022 so hopefully the 118 while still\nhaving extra climbs the super fun\nlollipop going into the mountains will\nbe the best of both worlds for this new\nfocofondo course\nfor great gravel races and one nice\nprice if you want to go all in on the\nseries Colorado gravel racing kicks off\nhere in a few weeks with old man winter\nrally February 5th last year Alex and\nanother former U.S national road\nChampion Ruth Winder took the wins we'll\nsee who comes out on top this year and\nthen we've got a full spring summer and\nfall of gravel races with more than a\ndozen good events here in Colorado those\ninclude\nWild Horse Weld County grinder mad\ngravel Pony Express Bighorn gravel\ncrooked gravel Steamboat
