      "transcript": "[Laughter]\n[Music]\nall\ngood morning it's\nuh ride time in the country so I'm in\nwalli the first time in my life and I've\ntaken my son with me in another laner\ncar from Hyundai this one's a cona and\nit's our first experience in an all El\nelectric vehicle and we're about 140 150\nmaybe 160 km north of Sydney and guess\nwhat we got here on a charge and we'll\nget back on on a charge and life is\ngood because we're up in Christy scrier\ncountry this is\num the weekend of the first wmi gravel\nFest and we turned up on Friday evening\nit's now Saturday morning we had a\ndelicious dinner at Myrtle and\nstone we bumped into a couple of other\nbike riders well actually quite a lot of\nother bike riders including valter botas\nand Tiffany Cromwell and a bunch of\nothers who have links with this\nwonderful thing we call cycling and um I\ncan't tell you the time\nbecause but um I'll have a look on my\nother timing device 6:21 which means\nthat in an hour in 9 minutes we'll be a\nkilometer and a half down that way at\nmyrt and stone Cafe in Mamay\nValley 150 odd kilometers north of\nSydney on a magical Day made for cycling\nand we'll be joining um a bunch of other\npeople to go and ride some gravel roads\nso that's what I'm doing\nhere and I couldn't have asked for\nbetter\nconditions this is the story of my ride\nfor the sumers solstice of\n2024 21st of December join me and let's\nsee what the wmi gravel Fest will\ndeliver\nHere Comes the\nSun how is it pretty good how's the bark\nyou ready yeah it's good\nI think the whole idea of this\nweekend is to get a bunch of people\ntogether who like the same thing and\nshowcase a region which is close to a\nbig\ncity which is appropriate for gravel\nriding isn't that Bloody simple and if\nyou live in\nSydney you know you can uh sketch out a\nrough route which gives you a little bit\nof off-road pleasure but uh to get there\nyou got to have a lot of on onroad\nangst\nbut it wasn't a long drive here it was a\nmagically beautiful drive it's also just\nbasically a glorious setting to find\nyourself in on a\nweekend it's time to lock up the tiny\nhouse and get off to the ride and I'll\nreport in from the gravel\ngate for me\nplease I've been bringing you along for\na holid\nthank you\nsir just rolled out the gate and have a\nlook at this I'll show you what I've\njust found this is a good thing look at\nthis\nsign and look at this face this is Liv\nGoen official jersey on and everything\nyou look great are you ready for a ride\nlook at your crew how many did you have\nthere them I've got lot of\nfriends are we going to talk properly\nlater for sure sweet should we ride our\nbikes yeah let's go you ready yeah right\nlet's do it\ntop spot height\nhave fun talk to everybody have a wave\nto CH and vter they going to start the\nride at the front and leave you out and\nI just think we probably won't do big\npack of a 100 all the way but just kind\nof you know gradually just kind of De\ngroup a little bit St vry do you want to\nsay\nanything uh firstly a big thank you to\nChristie and her team I think without\nthem we wouldn't be here um thanks to\nall of you for coming out and obviously\nto all the volunteers we're excited to\nbe here first time in Wai and looking\nforward to checking out the\ngravel yes good morning everyone really\ngood to be here and yeah thank you for\neveryone for organizing this I think\nthis is what travel is about so let's\nhave fun let's be safe and uh enjoy and\nuh let's be together off Che\nliterally just rolled away from mytle\nand stone we've uh Had a Little Ride\nbreaking and as Valkyrie reminded us\nthis is gravel which is to say have a\nbit of fun don't take it too seriously\nnot a races to ride pacing not racing\netc etc etc so I'm not going to talk too\nmuch but I'll try and document the day\nwhen I can\nearly days I actually don't even know\nhow far this ride is I did enough\nresearch to find myself here but the\nrest of the time I'm relying on Wy to\ntell me more of the detail because he\nreads the\ninstructions hello\nAllison Allison is the owner of chain\nSmith which is a sponsor and it's a bike\nshop on Cleveland Street in Sydney go\nthere and have a look\nit's yeah it's a little hole in the wall\nbut there's a lot of exotic run off\noh\nm\ngot a bit of a face on but it's you know\ncol and wheels it makes life a whole lot\neasier but um there's a few splits\nforming and P and Val group are at the\nfront of my group and they've let\nanother group go forward so maybe we'll\nget a tap we'll see how we go\nand the\ngravel perfect\nvery nice said at about\n30k I let him go\nand not much commentary because the\ncardas are\nperous first little stop and I'm 40K in\nand the first 30k I rode with everyone\nand then had went up here and I yeah I\nlost the Rhythm completely and utterly\nanyway uh little brief break maybe\nhopefully ideally at the top of the\nridge but I'm not\nsure the gravel has been pretty bloody\npressed in like you couldn't really ask\nfor a better surface for these kinds of\nbikes it's undulating it's interesting\nit's pretty it's buree not a single\ntraffic light what more could you\nwant it's just been up and then you\nthink oh there a\nridge my like that one and you think oh\nfor that that should be that Crest\nshould be the crest and it is BET only\nmomentarily so it's just up and down up\nand down up and down and\nthen I'm actually riding on Rock there\nlike one big rock like Sandstone like\nyeah gravel but\nHappy Happy\nDays behind me as I make this left hand\nturn is about the only Sunny packs the\nrest of it being pretty much under\nthe cooling shade of the Australian bush\nhere and there's not been much of\nthis has been pot or water\nso yeah dust the aesthetic but not too\nbad because I certainly not been on the\nwheels of many people because that ended\nan hour ago I'm 2 hours in uh ex well 2\nhours and 2 minutes now almost 50 km\n48.5\n30\u00b0 and\n94 M of\nclimbing and now camera in the pocket\nbecause bit of a uh bit of a Dipper\napparently\nfeel\nbe\njust wheel\nanything just let\ngo me\nfor my\nreality it's\nto I'm\nnot the\nwheel feel\nI've just piit 1,000 M of climbing and\nit's also\n33\u00b0\nso yeah that's all just a a DA update\nso apparently that's not that hard to go\nI'm just\num bit of a\nuh uh a fill up and a little bit of a\nchat with chrispy's Dad and um can\ncontinuing\ncontinuing if I was to compare this to\nthe gravel I\ndid um at po punka or Mount po punka I\nwell I would say there's no comparison\nthis was way easier to ride much\nsmoother I mean you need to keep your\nwit about yeah there's a couple of dips\nand stuff\nbut um yeah pretty easy and um certainly\na lot closer to\nSydney yeah a bit of bitman and some\nFields rather than forest and crucially\na momentary pause from the Sak song oh\nmy God it has been ferociously loud like\nextremely extremely l and I'm coming\nback into it\nbut what impresses me enormously is\norganizational\nability the Casual\nenvironment the coming together of\nmulti-generations of people who have had\ninvolvement with cycling\nprocycling and other sports like Formula\n1 all coming together casually only a\ncouple of days before Christmas well\nfour days and if it all just feeling so\nfirly and comfortable relaxing easy it's\nit's the scrio style I reckon like I\ncan't I can't express enough while I'm\npedaling along after 3 hours in consider\nconsiderably warm temperatures I can't\nexpress\nenough how impressed I am with Christy\nscrier as a an organizer a professional\nand a um\nwhat would you call it a Vibe Creator a\ngood vibe generator she's unreal and\nshe's done another outstanding job again\nwith the team that she's built out here\nin wenar but the SAR is are back so I'm\ngoing to shut up\ny\nalmost back to base\nso I think we've just had um the third\nfeed station which is terrific thank you\nvery\nmuch and uh now I think I'm going I\ndon't know what this is let's have a\nlook\nit wasn't a deliberate decision to um\njust keep going no matter what but just\nnow I was tempted to turn back and show\nyou something that I failed to film\nwhich this stunning piece of rock and\num\nanyway I guess it gives me a good excuse\nto ride again tomorrow and see what else\nI've find to make sure I have the camera\nat the\nready so little data update don't know\nhow many calories but I would say quite\na\nlot\num 80\nkm uh 1180 M of climbing\n36\u00b0 and so far for me 3 hours and 20\nminutes did I mention it's the Sol did I\nmention that Christmas is 4 days away\nhe\nI can't stand sitting in lra 1 second\nlonger than a ride"

      "transcript": "[Music]\nso I'm here to take any questions from\nyou guys so if you yeah feel like you've\nreally thought about any question all\nyour life you want to ask me I'm here\nplease ask what's next what's next\nwhat's next what is next what's next\nwhat's next\non the weekend before Christmas my son\nand I took a Drive North from Sydney to\nwenay for the first Wen by gravel\nFest this is part two of the story of\nour weekend in the\ncountry and with a welcome arrival of a\ngood dose of cloud cover day two of the\nwenar gravel Fest is about to begin the\nSaras is still\nsinging my son is still ahead of\nme and we had a terrific night at mytle\nand stone last night hanging out\nlistening to a formal interview with\nalre and Tiffany but Louis and I also\ncaught up with a pair of them for a good\nlong genuine easy cas ual chat about\nlife as pro athletes but also just\nbasically Life as a couple and Tiffy and\nVal thank you thank you thank you we had\na terrific night last night but also\nthanks for everything that you do when\nit comes to promoting the notion of\ncycling as fun that's what brings us to\nthe bike often it's what I suppose\ncements our love of um and activity\nand after you've relished the fun it may\nbecome a career or whatever but you\nshould never lose that essence of fun\nand I think that's the message that\nthey're trying to hammer home with these\ngravel events that they're\ndoing and while I get this Preamble out\nof the way I also want to say Louis my\nson who finished with valky and tiffs\ngroup\nyesterday was issued an invite from\nvalrey last night come to Rattle gravel\nbecause we' still got spots so first\nyear sold out like that cuz I had\nlimited spots of about 300 from my\nunderstanding this year\n2025 they've got openings for about a\nthousand people and there's still a few\n100 tickets available so if you're\nwatching this before rattle gravel and\nyou want to catch up with a pair of them\nI'd suggest jump on TDU or to down\nunder.com have a look at the link\nand do what you got to do and try and\nget Tade and uh understand a little bit\nabout what fun and cycling is all about\nin 2025\njust having a quick look\naround so not a lot of flowing water PL\nas the Carter found um and we came to\nget it we we tried to our best\nto um squeeze in a swim yet for the\nafternoon after the ride but we didn't\nfind an appropriate swimming hole sad\nface we'll see what we can do on the way\nhome today\nearly start 6K in and Cruis them with\nthe bun\nsay say lat\nL I dropped a bottle so I I stopped and\nnow I've I've dropped many near a\nwheel in other words I uh I didn't get\nback up to the front punch and uh so\nI've been isolated for 10 km and I think\nI'm\nlost but that's a promising sign isn't\nit\nn\nnot a long ride today in an out and back\ncourse and given my my stock and my\nlosing contact the good news is I'll be\nable to film\neveryone once they turn around and come\nback to me so I expect that to happen\npretty soon\nit is all\npretty and um sometimes it's worth\nstopping\ncome on you got to do it surely\nit's\nall good\nokay\nI\nthat was\nbad as I said earlier it's a much Sher\none today and I've just more or less\nfilmed from the bike because you know\nI've got to keep my hands on the on the\nhandle bars and hold on to a bit of\ncontrol but it's been really enjoyable\nwe scored great weather for the Sunday\nlike I would say at least 10\u00b0 cooler\nthan the Saturday and overcast so\nwithout the UV thing and everyone's\neveryone's friends now because we spent\nan evening together last night just\nhaving our barbecue hanging out and the\nbike the bike brings people together it\nuh it blurs the line between one sport\nand another it\nallows Discovery and family time and all\nsorts of benefits so I tried to find a\nnew way saying r a bike it's unreal\nevery time I say that but there's a w\nright to my left that he's scampered\ninto the bushes but it was there while I\nwas just trying to summarize today's\nride but it's still a big long some are\nahead of us including rattle gravel\nwhich I want to do this year and if I\ndon't do it hopefully Lou Will I hope\nyou do too and if you do you know make\nsure you give Tiff a big round of\napplause for all that she's done for\ncycling in Australia these last 15 20\nyears\nisn't it beautiful rhetorical question\nI don't know if you can tell but I am\nindeed a very proud\nAustralian\nand I love it\nthat situations like last night can\nunfold where you've got a bunch of\npeople sitting around you got a super\nduper famous finnished bloke sitting\namongst the m ofes and everyone is just\nquite simply mates\nin Monaco uh 2019 uh us through common\nfriends at the local PB on a d night\nyeah we're playing darts and then uh\nyeah shook hands with Tiffany nice to\nmeet you so on uh and um yeah eventually\nwe ended up on on a same bike ride\nobviously there's a good sports\nCommunity around there and U yeah ended\nup on the same bike ride and then I\ndon't know somehow we ended up on a bike\nride just me and viany and then we ended\nup having a\ncopy and\nthen the rest is history\nhello you want this yeah that's about as\nmuch but he was very finished at the\nstart like very quiet and was a and then\nI'm also not that outgoing until I get\nto know people but yeah I kind of went\nfrom there and I think it's we have\nsimil mentality like we're both trying\nto achieve the top of our sport we both\nlike adventures and travels I think it\njust matches he's more calm I'm more\nfiery so I think it also balances each\nother\nout yeah yep"
