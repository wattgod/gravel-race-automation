      "description": "When you've watched this, Watch this - https://youtu.be/euBN2ODkFYw \nThen see if your comments are still valid!\n\nWhile these signs strongly advise pedestrians to stay off cycling trails for safety, the legal situation is more complex.\n\nThe Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act) gave the public a new legal right of access to \"open access land\" in England and Wales. This land primarily includes mountain, moor, heath, and downland, and much of the land managed by Forestry England falls under this category. This means that, by law, the public has a right to walk on this land.\n\nTherefore, while a sign with a crossed-out person is a critical safety warning and should be respected, it does not always represent a legal prohibition. It's a way for Forestry England to manage risk and guide people towards safer, more suitable walking routes.\n\nThis reality highlights a significant challenge for forest management: balancing public access rights with the need for user safety. \n\nI have my opinions on this and clearly not everyone agrees, which is absolutely fine as is your right to agree or disagree. I'm not changing my opinion on the response I got but clearly the signage is not as clear cut as it first appeared.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below....\n\n\nFollow me on Socials\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mark_page_music_and_video/\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/red.bartape.productions/\n\ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSTRAVA: https://www.strava.com/athletes/10961024\n\ud83c\udfb5 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@markpagemtb\n\n \ud83d\udcb0 If you would like to make a small contribution to support the channel then please hit the SUPER THANKS button \ud83d\ude0a\n\n#calibre_bikes\n#MarkPageMTB\n#RedbartapeProductions\n#gopro\n#mtblife\n\nBikes:\nCalibre Triple B\nCalibre Two.

      "transcript": "[Music]\nlooking to get started with bik packing\nbut not sure where to begin in this\nvideo I'll be sharing five beginner\nfriendly rots across the UK If you are\nnew to bite packing these are the\nperfect routs to help you ease in we're\nstarting with the most challenging on\nthe list and working our way down to the\neasiest but they are all very much\nbeginner Roots so let's dive in with the\nhardest beginner route\nthe capital Trail is a fantastic option\nif you are looking to start bik packing\nin Scotland it's a 150 M Loop starting\nand finishing in the capital city\nEdinburgh and taking you through the\nscenic lowlands although it's a beginner\nfriendly route some sections lean\ntowards intermediate making it a great\nchoice if you are up for a bit of a\nchallenge\nthis route can be done on a gravel bike\nbut you will find a mountain bike makes\nthe tougher sections easier and a little\nmore\nfun those mountain bike gears are a big\nplus too especially for some of the\nsteeper climbs that will keep you\nworking hard one section to watch out\nfor is along the old drove road towards\nPeebles it's mostly an unridable long\nhiker bike where you'll be pushing the\nbike all the way up The Descent does\nbecome manageable at a certain point but\nthis is definitely the Root's most\nchallenging stretch it's not for the\nfaint-hearted but it's all part of the\nadventure and if you're looking for a\nchallenge it's a great route even though\nthe trails feel remote you're never\nactually that far away from civiliz\nization which is nice if you are not\nfamiliar with riding in very remote\nplaces if you are a complete beginner be\nprepared for some tough spots there's\nplenty of climbing exciting to sense and\nthe occasional hiker bike so yes it's a\nbeginner route but it's a Scottish\nbeginner route meaning it's a good route\nto test your resolve plan for around 2\nto 4 days to take it all in depending on\nyour pace and the weather which being\nScotland can be unpredictable the\nlowlands may not be as popular as the\nhighlands but they have their own rugged\ncharm that makes this ride truly\nmemorable the capital Trail is\ndefinitely worth a go if you are looking\nfor a first bik packing Adventure that\nwill leave you with lasting\nmemories last year after a series of\nillnesses that kept me off the bike I\ndecided it was time to ease back in with\na familiar and manageable route that's\nhow the two downs one Forest came to\nlife a 170 m Loop starting and finishing\nin brockenhurst in the New Forest this\nroute offers a real mix of terrain and\nscenery with around 10,000 fet of\nelevation gain to keep things\ninteresting it's definitely beginner\nfriendly but it's all also fairly lumpy\nso be ready for a good workout along the\nway the route takes you through three of\nseven England's most beautiful\nlandscapes you start in a New Forest\nwhich is packed with compact gravel\ntrails and Scenic Woodlands from there\nyou'll ride into the Rolling Hills of\nthe South Downs where you will find wide\nopen spaces and some fast flowing\ndescents and of course some lung busting\nclimbs\nfinally you'll head through to the\nNorthwest Downs climbing to Gallows down\nthe route's highest point where you'll\nbe rewarded with stunning views over the\nsurrounding Countryside even though it\ncovers remote feeling Trails this Loop\nnever takes you too far away from\ncivilization so you'll always have\nplenty of chances to stop and resupply\nalong the way and that that's a great\nbenefit for New Riders who want a bit of\nAdventure without committing to being\ntruly\nremote the trails are a mix with single\ntrack double track old byways and a few\nquiet country lanes to connect things\nsome of the single track sections I'll\nwarn you can get a little overgrown in\nthe summer months so be prepared for the\nodd rough patch here and there while you\ncan absolutely tackle this route on a\ngravel bike I'd say a mountain bike\nmakes it a little more enjoyable\nespecially on the single track where a\nmountain bike position and grippier\ntires are a real\nplus if you are going the gravel route\nI'd recommend at least 45 mm tires to\nkeep things comfortable on the varied\nsurfaces the two downs one Forest is all\nabout discovering the charm of the South\nof England from the gravel Tracks Of The\nNew Forest to the scenic climbs and\nsweeping Des scents of the South Downs\nthis Loop offers some great riding\nmemorable views and a bit of everything\nto make your bik packing Adventure\nUnforgettable this might be the only\nWelsh bite packing route I'd ever be\nable to put on a beginner list but the\nga is a stunning place to discover by\nbike located on the southwestern coast\nof Wales it has a unique charm that sets\nit apart from the more rugged areas of\nthe country it's softer and less wild\nbut still beautiful in its own right at\nonly 50 Mi this route is perfect for a\nleisurely day trip or relaxed\novernighter if you want to stretch it\nout while this area is less demanding\nthan much of whales you'll still find a\nfew steep climbs and descents just to\nremind you you are still in Wales so\nmake sure your brakes are in good work\nin order fortunately these climbs are\nfairly short but they still give you a\ntaste of the Rolling Welsh landscape the\nroute itself is beginner friendly with\nmost of the trails being straightforward\nand easy to navigate you'll follow a\nmixture of quiet pave roads and mellow\noff-road sections keeps things\ninteresting without adding too much of a\nchallenge there are a couple of steep\ndescents where it's worth taking it slow\nand you'll even have a short hiker bike\nthrough some Sandy Junes a nice bit of\nvariety and a chance to stretch the legs\nand enjoy them SE views the go route is\nideal if you're looking for a beginner\nfriendly Adventure that still has a bit\nof everything Scenic coastlines Rolling\nHills and the peaceful Countryside of\nWales it's a great way to experience a\ndifferent side of Wales and take in some\nFant fantastic Coastal views all on the\nmanageable and beautiful side whales can\nbe a hard place to ride so if you want\nto explore Wales you're a beginner the\ngawa is a great place to\nstart cycling UK's Rebellion way is\nprobably the most beginner friendly bik\npacking route I can think of you don't\nneed any Special K no need for a big\ntravel bike just a bit of Fitness to\ntackle the 230 Mi and since this route\nis in Norfolk you won't have to worry\nabout any lung busting climbs just a\ncouple of little draggy sections at most\nthis route primarily follows paved\nsurfaces including some dedicated cycle\npaths and quiet Country Roads however be\nprepared for a bit of traffic when\nleaving Norwich as it can get a little\nbusy depending on what time of day you\narrive and leave when you do head\noff-road the terrain is beginner\nfriendly with mostly flat double track\nand a couple of narrow Trails the\noff-road sections are relatively short\nso you'll spend more time riding on Tac\nthan actually off-road while I wouldn't\nrecommend using a traditional road bike\na gravel bike a hybrid or a cyc across\nbike with tires in the range of around\n30 to 35 mm would work just fine just a\nlittle bit of puncture protection for\nthe off-road sections providing a good\nbalance of comfort and grip what I love\nabout the Rebellion way is that it's\nmore about enjoying the scenery than\ntesting your limits with steep climbs\nit's closer to a touring route over a\nbik packing route really but\nnevertheless it's perfect for beginners\nand a fantastic way to experience the\nnorth Countryside whether you're\nplanning a 2 to 4 day trip or looking to\nstretch it out even longer this route is\na great choice just remember to take it\neasy enjoy the ride and embrace the\nlaidback Vibe of the area be sure to\ncheck out cycling UK for any updates or\nto read more about this route it's a\ngreat starting point for anyone looking\nto dive into the world of bite packing\nthere isn't too much to say about this\none it's the new Forest the area is\nknown for its maintained gravel paths\nmaking it an excellent choice for a\nbeginner B packing route the route does\ninclude one bride away that can\nsometimes get a bit muddy and overgrown\nbut it's not too long so it won't slow\nyour adventure too much the New Forest\nis perfect for beginners as it's mostly\nflat with just a couple of short climbs\nthese climbs are quite man manageable\nand honestly don't even register as\nclimbs for the more experienced Riders\nhowever if you are new to cycling you\nmight find them a little tiring with the\nright gearing though you should be just\nfine this route found on keepsmiling\nadventures.com differs slightly from the\none you'll find on bite packing.com as\nit removes the boggy Trail leading out\ntowards the Roger Penny way which is a\nlittle hard to follow and leads to a bus\nRoad and thankfully it doesn't cut out\nanything worthwhile and it doesn't\nshorten the route by much the total\ndistance is around 60 M making it a\ngreat option for either a single day\nride or a quick overnighter Adventure\nwhat I particularly enjoy about cycling\nThe New Forest is the opportunity to\nsoak in the beautiful scenery and\nWildlife get lost in nature of the New\nForest as the New Forest ponies Rope\nfree whether you're looking for a gentle\nintroduction to bite back in the\nstunning New Forest landscape this route\nis a fantastic choice and is no doubt\nthe easiest most beginner friendly bik\npacking route you could take on in the\nUK and there you have it five beginner\nfriendly bike packing routes across the\nUK from the beautiful landscapes of the\nNew Forest to the stunning Coastline of\nthe gawa each route offers its own\nunique charm and challenges where\nwhether you are tackling the scenic\nTrails of the Rebellion way or enjoying\nthe adventure of the two downs one\nForest if you are looking for a beginner\nfriendly bike packing route then these\nare some of the best routes to start\nwith in the UK remember the key is to\nenjoy the journey so take your time soak\nin the views and don't hesitate to stop\nand explore bik packing isn't just about\nreaching the Finish Line it's about the\nexperience and memories you create along\nthe way so keep smiling and enjoy the\nadventure it's a beautiful world out\nthere and just don't pass on the\nDare if you have a will and a moment to\nspare it's a beautiful world out there\nit's a beautiful world out\nthere it can be a bit frightening"

      "transcript": "hi guys and welcome back to keep smiling\nadventures and today we are going to be\ndoing the before you ride the kante way\nthe before you ride the route overview\neverything you need to know before\ntaking on the candy way i literally got\nback yesterday so it's fresh in my mind\nand as always i like to go through\nthe route everything you need to know\nanything that i discovered along the way\na route difficulty one being super easy\nanyone can do it 10 being super hard\nit's probably not gonna be for you and\nthen also a overall rating again one\nbeing don't bother\n10 being get out there and do it now\nbecause it is amazing so without further\nado let's get in to the before you ride\nthe canty way\nthe canty way is a cycling uk bike\npacking route around east kent the route\nis a\n145 mile or 234 kilometer loop that will\ntake you on an adventure with lots of\nbeauty and plenty of things to do along\nthe way old ruins lighthouses and plenty\nof sea views along the way\nplenty of opportunities for cafe stops\nand pub lunches this route uses\nbrideaways cycle tracks and quiet\ncountry lanes this route officially\nstarts in a place called y but as it is\na loop you can start in many different\nlocations with lots of train stations to\nget you to\nand from the start of this route\nthis route is mostly paved and traffic\nfree but does have some off-road\nsections that could become a bit muddy\nin the wetter months\nthe route itself is available in two\nversions both are the same distance but\none takes a more coastal route around\nmargate which can become busy but skips\nthe right harbour section the other\nskips the margate section but adds the\nwin chelsea loop around the rye harbour\nboth can be easily combined to do both\nthough as this route follows lots of\ndifferent types of ways it is best to\nhave a gps device for mac\n[Music]\nthe canty way is a great option if you\ndon't like going up hills as the route\nitself is pretty flat not completely\npancake flat but the few small hills\nthat there are on this route are few and\nfar between and are not too long or too\nsteep this route is also great for\nbeginners in the off-road departments as\nthe most of the off-road sections are\nmostly well-maintained gravel tracks\nwith a couple of short flowing single\ntrack bridleways\nbut for the most part you will be\nfollowing the coastline along the\nseafront\nthese are mostly paved surfaces if you\nhave been looking for a nice\nintroduction into the world of bike\npacking then this might be a good place\nto start with lots of places to stop for\nfood and water and many things to see\nalong the way the trails are mellow and\nnot too challenging making it a good\noption if you are new to going off-road\nif you are looking for a route that can\nbe done in anything from epic day ride\nor a two to four day trip this is a good\nplace to start especially if you are in\nthe south of england bear in mind this\nroute is based in kentnow and the area\nis pretty well built up and there are\ntimes it can get busy and although you\nwill mostly be riding on shared used\npaths there are times you will need to\nride on the road depending on the time\nof day or year\nsome of the coastal towns can become\nbusy\nbike of choice for this ride is going to\nreally be any bike that can take 30\nmillimeter plus tires as the route is\nmostly paved you don't need anything too\nspecial for the canty way tire choice\nshould be more towards the faster\nrolling tire but with a bit of\nprotection and grip for the off-road\nsections anything from a gravel bike to\na hybrid a touring bike will be your\nbest bet you could probably even manage\nthis on a road bike as for the majority\nof this route\nis all paved but there will be a few\nsections that might be a bit rough if\nyou decide to do that and expect a few\nscratches on your road bike\nas you are riding around kent a well\npopulated area this does make wild\ncamping a little more harder with remote\nplaces being few and far between\nso being as stealth as possible is the\nbest way here the bivvy will give you\nthe best chance of this\nhammock camping on this route would not\nbe recommended as for the most part on\nthis route there is very little or no\nsections of trees to set up apart from\none area where you go onto the north\ndowns there are plenty of official\ncampsites in kent but being a rather\nbusy place it's best to book as early as\npossible if you are going down that\nroute plenty of hotels and bnbs along\nthis route also but again book as early\nas possible\nplenty of places to start this route\nthanks to it going through many places\nwith trade stations including win\nchelsea rai ashford y canterbury\nwhitstable margate\ndeal\ndover you get the idea this route is\nwell stacked in your favor for getting\nto the start and finish by train but\nbear in mind that trains can get very\nbusy and bike spaces are very limited so\nit's best to book your bike on before\ntraveling and avoid traveling at peak\nhours\nthe difficulty of this ride is going to\nbe an easy three out of ten for me this\nwhole route is very straightforward and\na very easy\nride i think even a complete beginner in\nthe world of bike packing will be fine\nwith all of this route as long as you\nhave a reasonable level of fitness to\ncover the distance\nbeing such a flat route makes this route\nrelatively easy to cover a good amount\nof distance each day leaving plenty of\ntime to be able to stop and enjoy the\nsurrounding areas\nmy final rating is going to be a 6 out\nof 10. this route is a really enjoyable\nroute to do and i think if you are\nlooking to dive into the world of bike\npacking or touring then this is a good\nroute to start with i will say i would\npersonally say this\nroute is more leaning towards a touring\nroute over a fully fledged bike packing\nroute being that the majority of this\nroute is actually on paved surfaces as\nopposed to off-road\nbut whatever you want to call it if you\nare looking for a nice enjoyable\nleisurely trip on your bicycle then this\nis a great option to check out plenty of\nplaces to stop lots to see and lots of\ngood spots to have a dip in the sea\nthe top tip for this route is going to\nbe to get to whitstable as early as\npossible to make a start on the busier\ncoastal section of this route to really\nget to enjoy as the sun rises\nso there we have it guys there is my\nbefore you ride the kante way it's a\ngenerally it's a really easy to ride\nroute there's nothing too technical it's\njust like enjoyable lots of like sea\nviews if you like the sea like i do if\nyou're drawn to the sea then you'll\ndefinitely just enjoy this as just a\ngeneral bike ride it's not overly hard\nbut it's just it's just nice that is\nwhat i'm saying it's just a nice ride\nright guys that is it before you ride if\nyou enjoyed this video give it a thumbs\nup if
